# Core Issue Focus Example: Feature Implementation

**Scenario:** Feature implementation with MVP focus and deferred enhancements
**Agent:** CodeChanger
**GitHub Issue:** #DEF - Users cannot filter recipes by ingredient
**Skill Usage:** Demonstrates mission discipline for feature additions

---

## SCENARIO OVERVIEW

### User Need
Users want to filter recipes by ingredient to find recipes using specific items they have available. Current recipe search only supports text search by recipe name, limiting discoverability.

### Scope Expansion Risks
- **Feature Enhancements:** Advanced filter combinations, exclude ingredients, dietary restrictions
- **Performance Optimizations:** Caching, indexing, query optimization
- **UI/UX Improvements:** Filter interface redesign, mobile optimization, filter presets
- **Related Features:** Save filters, filter history, recommended filters

---

## STEP 1: IDENTIFY CORE ISSUE FIRST

### Core Issue Analysis

**Core Blocking Problem:**
Users cannot filter recipes by ingredient, limiting recipe discoverability to text search by name only.

**Why This Blocks Progress:**
Users with specific ingredients available cannot efficiently find relevant recipes, reducing platform usefulness and user engagement. This represents the #1 requested feature in user feedback (47 requests in last 3 months).

**Minimum Viable Fix:**
Add single ingredient filter parameter to recipe search API endpoint and implement basic filtering logic in RecipeService. Return recipes containing the specified ingredient.

**What Approaches are OUT OF SCOPE:**

- **Advanced filter combinations (multiple ingredients, AND/OR logic)**
  - Why Valid: Significantly improves search flexibility and user experience
  - Why Deferred: Requires complex query logic, UI redesign, separate feature scope

- **Filter performance optimization (caching, indexing)**
  - Why Valid: Important for scalability as recipe catalog grows
  - Why Deferred: Not required for MVP, separate performance optimization work

- **Enhanced filter UI with presets and saved filters**
  - Why Valid: Improves user experience and encourages filter adoption
  - Why Deferred: Frontend feature requiring UX design, separate implementation effort

- **Exclude ingredients filter (find recipes NOT containing X)**
  - Why Valid: Valuable for allergies and dietary restrictions
  - Why Deferred: Different use case from "find recipes with X", separate feature

**Success Criteria:**
1. [ ] Recipe search API accepts optional "ingredient" query parameter
2. [ ] API returns recipes containing specified ingredient (case-insensitive match)
3. [ ] API returns empty array for ingredient with no matching recipes
4. [ ] Frontend recipe search component passes ingredient filter to API
5. [ ] Unit tests validate ingredient filtering logic
6. [ ] Integration test confirms end-to-end ingredient filtering

- Why Valid: Improves query performance as recipe catalog scales
- Why Deferred: Current catalog size (500 recipes) doesn't require optimization, premature
- Future Work: Performance epic "Recipe search scalability"
- Estimated Impact: Sub-100ms query performance for 10,000+ recipes

**UI Enhancement 1: Filter interface redesign**
- Description: Dedicated filter panel with autocomplete, recent searches, popular filters
- Why Valid: Improves user experience and filter discoverability
- Why Deferred: Requires UX design, separate frontend feature effort
- Future Work: Frontend epic "Recipe search UX improvements"
- Estimated Impact: 25% increase in filter usage based on A/B testing similar features

**UI Enhancement 2: Saved filters**
- Description: Allow users to save frequent filter combinations for quick access
- Why Valid: Convenience for users with specific dietary patterns
- Why Deferred: Requires user preferences infrastructure, separate feature scope
- Future Work: Issue #GHI "User recipe search preferences"
- Estimated Impact: Improved user engagement for return visitors

**INTEGRATION BOUNDARIES:**

**Database:** Read-only queries
- Integration Type: Read-only dependency
- Changes Needed: None - use existing Recipe.Ingredients navigation property
- Validation: Verify ingredient filtering works with existing schema

**Frontend State Management:** Minimal changes
- Integration Type: Add filter parameter to existing search state
- Changes Needed: Add ingredient property to RecipeSearchParams interface
- Validation: Verify search state updates correctly with ingredient filter

## STEP 3: MISSION DRIFT DETECTION (During Implementation)

### Tempting Improvements Identified

**Temptation 1: "I should add autocomplete for ingredient input while I'm in the component"**
- **Classification:** ❌ SCOPE CREEP
- **Rationale:** Valid UX improvement but requires autocomplete component integration, separate effort
- **Action:** ADD_TO_DEFERRED_LIST (Frontend epic "Recipe search UX improvements")
- **Discipline Maintained:** ✅ Used simple text input, documented autocomplete for future

**Temptation 2: "The query is slow, let me add database index for ingredients"**
- **Classification:** ❌ SCOPE CREEP (Premature Optimization)
- **Rationale:** Current catalog (500 recipes) performs adequately (~50ms query time)
- **Action:** ADD_TO_DEFERRED_LIST (Performance epic when catalog exceeds 5,000 recipes)
- **Discipline Maintained:** ✅ Measured performance, deferred until actual bottleneck

**Temptation 3: "Users probably want multiple ingredient filtering, I'll implement that logic"**
- **Classification:** ❌ SCOPE CREEP (Feature Enhancement)
- **Rationale:** Separate feature requiring UI for multiple inputs, query builder complexity
- **Action:** ADD_TO_DEFERRED_LIST (Issue #XYZ "Advanced recipe filtering")
- **Discipline Maintained:** ✅ Single ingredient filter only, comprehensive for next iteration

**Temptation 4: "I should refactor RecipeService search logic while I'm here"**
- **Classification:** ❌ SCOPE CREEP (Opportunistic Refactoring)
- **Rationale:** Existing search logic works, refactoring not required for ingredient filter
- **Action:** ADD_TO_DEFERRED_LIST (Tech debt "RecipeService search refactoring")
- **Discipline Maintained:** ✅ Added ingredient filter to existing pattern, no refactoring

**Temptation 5: "Let me add validation for ingredient name format"**
- **Classification:** ⚠️ BORDERLINE - Evaluated carefully
- **Evaluation:** Basic null/empty validation reasonable, complex format validation scope creep
- **Decision:** Add null/empty check only (prevents API errors), defer format validation
- **Discipline Maintained:** ✅ Minimal validation for correctness, comprehensive validation deferred

### Mission Drift Warning Signs Monitored

**Red Flags Checked:**
- ✅ Modified files: 6 (RecipeService, RecipeController, RecipeServiceTests, recipe-search.component, recipe.service, types) - matches scope definition
- ✅ Implementation time: Within estimate (simple parameter addition and LINQ filter)
- ✅ Improvements not in success criteria: All deferred (autocomplete, indexing, multiple filters)
- ✅ Changes to unrelated code: None - only search functionality touched
- ✅ New abstractions: None - used existing patterns (query parameters, LINQ)

**Healthy Focus Confirmed:**
- ✅ All changes enable single ingredient filtering (core user need)
- ✅ Success criteria guided implementation (API parameter + frontend integration)
- ✅ Deferred list grew systematically (5 valid improvements documented)
- ✅ MVP delivered without feature bloat

**Criterion 3:** API returns empty array for ingredient with no matching recipes
- **Status:** ✅ MET
- **Evidence:** GET /api/recipes/search?ingredient=unicorn returns 200 OK with empty array []
- **Validation:** Graceful handling of no matches, no errors

**Criterion 4:** Frontend recipe search component passes ingredient filter to API
- **Status:** ✅ MET
- **Evidence:** Ingredient input field renders, typing "tomato" triggers API call with parameter
- **Validation:** Verified network request includes ingredient=tomato query parameter

**Criterion 5:** Unit tests validate ingredient filtering logic
- **Status:** ✅ MET
- **Evidence:** SearchRecipes_WithIngredient_ReturnsMatchingRecipes passes (validates LINQ logic)
- **Validation:** RecipeServiceTests suite includes 2 new tests for ingredient filtering

**Overall Success Criteria Status:** ALL MET ✅

### Core Functionality Validation

**Problem Before Fix:**
- User searches for "chicken" (recipe name search)
- Returns 2 recipes with "chicken" in name
- Misses 6 recipes containing chicken but with different names (e.g., "Honey Garlic Delight")
- User feedback: "Can't find recipes using ingredients I have"

**Problem After Fix:**
- User searches for "chicken" using ingredient filter
- Returns all 8 recipes containing chicken ingredient
- Includes recipes with chicken regardless of recipe name
- User can discover recipes by ingredient availability

**Evidence of Resolution:**
- Manual testing: Ingredient filter returns expected results for common ingredients

# Multi-Agent Coordination Example

**Scenario:** TestEngineer creates coverage analysis ‚Üí DocumentationMaintainer updates README
**Purpose:** Demonstrate artifact discovery, reporting, and integration across sequential agent workflow
**Educational Value:** Shows how protocols prevent context gaps and enable effective coordination

---

## Scenario Context

**GitHub Issue:** #450 - Improve Recipe Service Test Coverage
**Objective:** Increase Recipe service test coverage from 45% to 95%
**Agent Workflow:** TestEngineer (analysis) ‚Üí TestEngineer (implementation) ‚Üí DocumentationMaintainer (README update)

---

## Agent 1: TestEngineer (Coverage Analysis Phase)

### Step 1: Pre-Work Artifact Discovery

TestEngineer begins by checking working directory:

```
üîç WORKING DIRECTORY DISCOVERY:
- Current artifacts reviewed: None found (empty working directory)
- Relevant context found: N/A - starting fresh coverage analysis
- Integration opportunities: N/A - initial work for Issue #450
- Potential conflicts: None identified
```

**Rationale:** Even with empty working directory, TestEngineer reports discovery attempt, establishing baseline for communication protocols.

---

### Step 2: Immediate Artifact Reporting

After creating coverage analysis, TestEngineer reports:

```
üóÇÔ∏è WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED:
- Filename: recipe-service-coverage-analysis.md
- Purpose: Test coverage gap analysis for Recipe service identifying 15 missing test cases across CRUD operations; intended for TestEngineer test implementation and DocumentationMaintainer README updates
- Context for Team: Current coverage is 45% with critical gaps in error handling, edge cases, and integration scenarios; implementing these 15 tests will achieve 95% target coverage
- Dependencies: None - foundational coverage analysis based on production code review
- Next Actions: TestEngineer to implement identified test cases; DocumentationMaintainer to update README with coverage metrics after tests complete
```

**Artifact Contents (recipe-service-coverage-analysis.md):**
```markdown
# Recipe Service Coverage Analysis - Issue #450

## Current Coverage: 45%
- Unit Tests: 8 tests covering basic CRUD happy paths
- Integration Tests: 2 tests for API endpoints
- Missing: Error handling, edge cases, validation scenarios

## Identified Gaps (15 Missing Tests)

### Create Recipe Operation (5 tests)
1. CreateRecipe_WithNullIngredients_ThrowsValidationException
2. CreateRecipe_WithDuplicateName_ThrowsConflictException
3. CreateRecipe_WithInvalidCookingTime_ThrowsValidationException
4. CreateRecipe_WithMaximumIngredients_CreatesSuccessfully
5. CreateRecipe_Integration_PersistsToDatabase

### Read Recipe Operation (3 tests)
6. GetRecipe_NonExistentId_ThrowsNotFoundException
7. GetRecipesByCategory_EmptyCategory_ReturnsEmptyList
8. GetRecipesByCategory_Integration_FiltersCorrectly

### Update Recipe Operation (4 tests)
9. UpdateRecipe_NonExistentId_ThrowsNotFoundException
10. UpdateRecipe_WithNullIngredients_ThrowsValidationException
11. UpdateRecipe_ConcurrentModification_ThrowsConflictException
12. UpdateRecipe_Integration_UpdatesPersistence

### Delete Recipe Operation (3 tests)
13. DeleteRecipe_NonExistentId_ThrowsNotFoundException
14. DeleteRecipe_WithActiveBookings_ThrowsConflictException
15. DeleteRecipe_Integration_RemovesFromDatabase

## Expected Coverage After Implementation: 95%
## Implementation Priority: High (blocking feature completion)
```

**Communication Impact:** DocumentationMaintainer now knows exactly what tests will be created and can prepare README updates accordingly.

- Relevant context found: Complete list of 15 missing test cases with clear specifications
- Integration opportunities: Will implement all 15 identified tests following existing test patterns
- Potential conflicts: None - clear implementation plan established
```

**Rationale:** TestEngineer discovers own prior analysis, confirming context continuity across re-engagements.

---

### Step 2: Immediate Artifact Reporting

After implementing tests, TestEngineer reports:

```
üóÇÔ∏è WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED:
- Filename: recipe-service-test-implementation-complete.md
- Purpose: Test implementation completion report confirming all 15 tests created, passing, and achieving 95% coverage target; intended for DocumentationMaintainer README update
- Context for Team: Coverage increased from 45% to 96% (exceeded 95% target); all tests passing; comprehensive error handling, edge cases, and integration scenarios now validated
- Dependencies: Builds upon recipe-service-coverage-analysis.md (implemented all identified gaps)
- Next Actions: DocumentationMaintainer to update Recipe service README with new coverage metrics and test strategy documentation
```

---

### Step 3: Context Integration Reporting

TestEngineer documents integration with prior analysis:

```
üîó ARTIFACT INTEGRATION:

## Agent 1: BackendSpecialist (API Implementation)

### Step 1: Pre-Work Artifact Discovery

BackendSpecialist begins feature implementation:

```
üîç WORKING DIRECTORY DISCOVERY:
- Current artifacts reviewed: recipe-sharing-requirements.md (created by ArchitecturalAnalyst)
- Relevant context found: Complete feature requirements including privacy controls (public/private/friends), unique link generation, and analytics tracking
- Integration opportunities: Will use requirements to design REST API endpoints following existing Recipe service patterns
- Potential conflicts: None - requirements clear and compatible with existing architecture
```

**Existing Artifact Context (recipe-sharing-requirements.md - created earlier):**
```markdown
# Recipe Sharing Feature Requirements

## Core Functionality
- Generate unique shareable links for recipes (UUID-based)
- Privacy controls: public, private (password-protected), friends-only
- Link analytics: track views, shares, origin
- Link expiration options: never, 24h, 7d, 30d

## API Requirements
- POST /api/recipes/{id}/share - Generate share link
- GET /api/recipes/shared/{shareId} - Access shared recipe
- PUT /api/recipes/shared/{shareId} - Update share settings
- DELETE /api/recipes/shared/{shareId} - Revoke share link
- GET /api/recipes/shared/{shareId}/analytics - View share analytics
```

**Rationale:** BackendSpecialist discovers ArchitecturalAnalyst's requirements artifact, enabling API design aligned with feature specifications.

**Endpoint:** POST /api/recipes/{id}/share
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "privacyLevel": "public|private|friends",
  "password": "optional-for-private",
  "expiresIn": "never|24h|7d|30d"
}
```
**Response:** RecipeShareDto with shareId, shareUrl, expiresAt

### 2. Access Shared Recipe
**Endpoint:** GET /api/recipes/shared/{shareId}
**Query Params:** password (required for private shares)
**Response:** SharedRecipeDto with recipe details, owner info, share metadata

### 3-5. Update, Delete, Analytics endpoints...

## Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE RecipeShares (
  Id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY,
  RecipeId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER FOREIGN KEY,
  ShareUrl NVARCHAR(500) UNIQUE,
  PrivacyLevel NVARCHAR(20),
  PasswordHash NVARCHAR(500) NULL,
  ExpiresAt DATETIME2 NULL,
  CreatedAt DATETIME2,
  ViewCount INT DEFAULT 0
)
```

## Key Implementation Details
- Share URLs: `https://zarichney-api.com/shared/recipes/{uuid}`
- Password hashing: BCrypt for private shares
- Link expiration: Background service checks every 1 hour
- Analytics: Tracked in ShareAnalytics table with views, origins, timestamps

## Frontend Integration Notes
- All endpoints require authentication except GET /shared/{shareId}
- Use ShareRecipeDialog component pattern for UI
- Privacy level selector should default to "public"
- Show password field only when "private" selected
- Display analytics as chart (suggest Chart.js integration)

## Testing Recommendations
- Integration tests: All 5 endpoints with various privacy levels
- E2E tests: Complete share workflow (create ‚Üí share ‚Üí access)
- Security tests: Password protection, expired link handling
- Performance tests: High-volume share link generation
```

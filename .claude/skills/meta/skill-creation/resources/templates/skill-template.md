## PLACEHOLDER GUIDANCE FOR PROMPTENGINEER

### YAML Frontmatter Customization

**name:**
- Format: lowercase-with-hyphens
- Max: 64 characters
- No reserved words (help, list, all, none)
- Example: `working-directory-coordination`, `api-design-patterns`, `github-issue-creation`

**description:**
- Max: 1024 characters
- MUST include: "What" the skill does + "When" to use it
- Format: "[What skill does]. Use when [trigger scenarios]. [Efficiency metric if applicable]."
- Example: "Team communication protocols for artifact discovery and reporting. Use when creating/discovering working directory files to maintain team awareness. Prevents communication gaps and enables 87% context efficiency improvement."

### Section Customization Priority

**Lines 1-80 (Always Loaded - Critical Content):**
- Purpose and Core Mission (Lines 14-30)
- When to Use scenarios (Lines 32-60)
- Workflow Steps overview (Lines 70-80)

**Lines 81-300 (Loaded When Skill Invoked - Core Execution):**
- Complete Workflow Steps with processes and checklists
- Target Agents with integration patterns
- Resources overview (references only, not full content)

**Lines 301-500 (Loaded On-Demand - Advanced Content):**
- Integration with Team Workflows
- Success Metrics
- Troubleshooting

### Token Budget Allocation

| Skill Category | YAML Frontmatter | SKILL.md Body | Resources | Total Context Load |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Coordination   | ~100 tokens      | 2,000-3,500   | Variable  | 2,100-3,600+      |
| Documentation  | ~100 tokens      | 2,500-4,000   | Variable  | 2,600-4,100+      |
| Technical      | ~100 tokens      | 3,000-5,000   | Extensive | 3,100-5,000+      |
| Meta           | ~100 tokens      | 3,500-5,000   | Comprehensive | 3,600-5,000+ |
| Workflow       | ~100 tokens      | 2,000-3,500   | Variable  | 2,100-3,600+      |

**Estimation:** 1 line ≈ 8 tokens (average), target <500 lines for SKILL.md

### Resource Organization Guidelines

**Templates Directory (`resources/templates/`):**
- Purpose: Copy-paste formats with clear placeholders
- Size: 30-60 lines each (200-500 tokens)
- Naming: `[purpose]-template.md`
- Content: {{PLACEHOLDER}} syntax with customization guidance

**Examples Directory (`resources/examples/`):**
- Purpose: Complete workflow demonstrations with annotations
- Size: 100-200 lines each (500-1,500 tokens)
- Naming: `[scenario]-example.md`
- Content: Realistic zarichney-api scenarios with decision explanations

**Documentation Directory (`resources/documentation/`):**
- Purpose: Deep dives for complex concepts
- Size: 250-400 lines each (1,000-3,000 tokens)
- Naming: `[topic]-guide.md`
- Content: Table of contents for >100 lines, comprehensive coverage

### Quality Validation Checklist

Before deploying skill:
- [ ] YAML frontmatter includes both "what" and "when" in description
- [ ] All required sections present (Purpose, When to Use, Workflow Steps, Target Agents, Resources, Integration)
- [ ] Optional sections used appropriately (Success Metrics, Troubleshooting)
- [ ] SKILL.md within token budget for skill category
- [ ] Critical content front-loaded (lines 1-80)
- [ ] Resources organized (templates/examples/documentation)
- [ ] Resource references one level deep from SKILL.md
- [ ] Tested with at least 2 target agents
- [ ] Progressive loading validated (metadata → instructions → resources)
- [ ] Token efficiency measured vs. embedded approach

### Common Template Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **DO NOT:**
- Embed full template content in SKILL.md (reference in resources/ instead)
- Use nested resource references (keep one level deep)
- Create skills for single-agent patterns (below reusability threshold)
- Exceed token budget without extracting to resources
- Omit "when to use" from YAML description
- Skip validation testing with target agents

✅ **DO:**
- Front-load critical content for progressive loading
- Use consistent placeholder syntax ({{PLACEHOLDER_NAME}})
- Reference resources one level deep from SKILL.md
- Validate reusability threshold (3+ agents for coordination, 2+ for workflow/technical)
- Include both "what" and "when" in YAML description
- Test with real agent tasks before deployment

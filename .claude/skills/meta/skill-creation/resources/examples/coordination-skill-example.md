# Skill Creation Example: Working Directory Coordination

**Skill Category**: Coordination Skill (Multi-Agent Pattern)
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Purpose**: Demonstrate complete 5-phase workflow for creating a coordination skill used by ALL agents

---

## Example Overview

This example shows how the **working-directory-coordination** skill was created to solve a critical multi-agent communication gap. Before this skill existed, agents were creating working directory artifacts without proper team awareness, causing context loss and coordination failures.

### The Problem This Skill Solved
- **Context Gap**: Agents created artifacts without reporting to team
- **Coordination Failure**: Other agents couldn't discover existing work
- **Communication Inconsistency**: No standardized artifact reporting format
- **Team Awareness**: Claude lacked visibility into agent artifacts

### The Solution Approach
Create a coordination skill that:
- Defines mandatory communication protocols
- Provides standardized reporting templates
- Enables artifact discovery workflows
- Integrates with ALL 11 agents seamlessly

---

## Phase 1: Scope Definition & Discovery

### 1.1 Initial Scope Assessment

**CORE ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:
```yaml
Problem: Multi-agent working directory communication gaps
Impact: Context loss, coordination failures, duplicate work
Affected_Agents: ALL 11 agents (100% team coverage)
Current_State: Ad-hoc artifact creation without team notification
Desired_State: Mandatory communication protocols with standardized formats
```

**DESIGN DECISION #1**: This is a **Coordination Skill** because:
- ‚úÖ Used by ALL agents (not domain-specific)
- ‚úÖ Solves communication/coordination problem (not technical implementation)
- ‚úÖ Establishes team-wide protocols (not specialist knowledge)
- ‚úÖ Relatively stable pattern (not frequently changing)

### 1.2 Token Budget Analysis

**Current Embedded State** (before skill extraction):
```markdown
# Agent Definition: CodeChanger.md
## Working Directory Communication Standards
### Mandatory Team Communication Protocol...
[~150 tokens of communication protocols embedded]

# Agent Definition: TestEngineer.md
## Working Directory Communication Standards
### Mandatory Team Communication Protocol...
[~150 tokens duplicated]

# Agent Definition: DocumentationMaintainer.md
## Working Directory Communication Standards
### Mandatory Team Communication Protocol...
[~150 tokens duplicated]

# ... repeated across ALL 11 agents
```

**Total Embedded Cost**: 11 agents √ó 150 tokens = **1,650 tokens**

**Proposed Skill Reference State**:
```markdown
# Agent Definition: CodeChanger.md
See /working-directory-coordination skill for artifact communication protocols
[~20 tokens reference]

# ... repeated across ALL 11 agents
```

**Total Reference Cost**: 11 agents √ó 20 tokens = **220 tokens**

**TOKEN SAVINGS**: 1,650 - 220 = **1,430 tokens (87% reduction)**

### 1.3 Skill Category Selection

**Template Choice**: `coordination-skill-template.md`

**Rationale**:
- Multi-agent pattern (ALL 11 agents)
- Communication/coordination focus (not technical implementation)
- Stable protocols (infrequent changes expected)
- Team-wide standards (not specialist-specific)

### 1.4 Progressive Loading Strategy

**Metadata Layer** (~100 tokens):
```yaml
name: working-directory-coordination
category: coordination
audience: all-agents
trigger_patterns: ["artifact", "working directory", "/working-dir/"]
token_budget:
  metadata: ~100
  full_skill: ~2,500
  resources: ~1,500
```

**SKILL.md Layer** (~2,500 tokens):
- Core communication protocols
- Standardized reporting formats
- Artifact discovery workflows
- Integration requirements

**Resources Layer** (~1,500 tokens):
- Artifact reporting templates
- Discovery workflow examples
- Communication format samples
- Integration guides

**Total Skill Budget**: ~4,100 tokens (vs. 1,650 embedded)
- **Initial Cost**: Higher (2.5√ó embedded cost)
- **Scalability**: Linear growth (vs. quadratic for embedding)
- **Maintenance**: Single source of truth (vs. 11 duplicate locations)

---

## Phase 2: Structure Design

### 2.1 Skill Structure Blueprint

**Directory Structure**:
```
.claude/skills/working-directory-coordination/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.yaml                    # ~100 tokens
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md                         # ~2,500 tokens
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artifact-creation.md     # Reporting template
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artifact-discovery.md    # Discovery template
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ context-integration.md   # Integration template
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ successful-coordination.md
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ failure-recovery.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ guides/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ enforcement-checklist.md
```

**DESIGN DECISION #2**: Three-tier progressive loading
- **Tier 1**: Metadata for quick reference/trigger matching
- **Tier 2**: SKILL.md for complete protocols when engaged
- **Tier 3**: Resources for templates/examples when needed

### 2.2 SKILL.md Content Structure

**Section Planning**:
```markdown
# Working Directory Coordination Skill

## Purpose & Scope
[Problem solved, team coverage, integration points]

## Core Communication Protocols
### 1. Pre-Work Artifact Discovery (MANDATORY)
### 2. Immediate Artifact Reporting (MANDATORY)
### 3. Context Integration Reporting (REQUIRED)

## Standardized Reporting Formats
[Templates with annotations]

## Workflow Integration
[How this integrates with existing agent workflows]

## Enforcement & Compliance
[Claude's role in protocol enforcement]

## Troubleshooting & Recovery
[Common failures and solutions]
```

**DESIGN DECISION #3**: Mandatory vs. Required distinction
- **MANDATORY**: Absolute requirement, engagement stops without compliance
- **REQUIRED**: Expected protocol, coordination adapts if missing
- Clear severity hierarchy helps Claude enforce appropriately

### 2.3 Resource Organization

**Template Philosophy**:
```yaml
artifact-creation.md:
  Purpose: Copy-paste template for reporting new artifacts
  Format: Emoji headers for visual scanning
  Fields: Minimal required information
  Example: Filled template showing actual usage

artifact-discovery.md:
  Purpose: Checklist for pre-work artifact review
  Format: Question-based prompts
  Fields: Context assessment questions
  Example: Discovery report from real engagement

context-integration.md:
  Purpose: Template for building on other agents' work
  Format: Source tracking and value addition
  Fields: Integration points and handoff preparation
  Example: Multi-agent coordination scenario
```

**DESIGN DECISION #4**: Templates over prose
- Agents need actionable formats, not explanatory text
- Copy-paste ready reduces cognitive load
- Examples show expected output quality

---

## Phase 3: Progressive Loading Implementation

### 3.1 Metadata Design (Tier 1)

### 3.2 SKILL.md Design (Tier 2)

**Opening Context** (~300 tokens):
```markdown
# Working Directory Coordination Skill

## Purpose & Scope

### Problem Solved
Multi-agent development requires seamless context transfer through shared artifacts.
Before this skill, agents created working directory files without team awareness,
causing:
- **Context Loss**: Other agents couldn't discover existing work
- **Duplicate Effort**: Repeated analysis without building on prior artifacts
- **Coordination Gaps**: Claude lacked visibility into agent progress
- **Communication Inconsistency**: No standardized reporting format

### Team Coverage
**ALL 11 AGENTS** must follow these protocols:
- CodeChanger, TestEngineer, DocumentationMaintainer, PromptEngineer
- ComplianceOfficer, FrontendSpecialist, BackendSpecialist, SecurityAuditor
- WorkflowEngineer, BugInvestigator, ArchitecturalAnalyst

### Integration Points
- Agent engagement preparation (pre-work discovery)
- Artifact creation (immediate reporting)
- Multi-agent coordination (context integration)
- Claude orchestration (compliance enforcement)
```

**Core Protocols Section** (~1,200 tokens):
```markdown
## Core Communication Protocols

### 1. Pre-Work Artifact Discovery (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK**, agents must check `/working-dir/` for relevant artifacts:

```
üîç WORKING DIRECTORY DISCOVERY:
- Current artifacts reviewed: [list existing files checked]
- Relevant context found: [artifacts that inform current work]
- Integration opportunities: [how existing work will be built upon]
- Potential conflicts: [any overlapping concerns identified]
```

**Workflow Integration**:
1. Agent receives task from Claude
2. **FIRST ACTION**: Review `/working-dir/` contents
3. Identify artifacts from prior agent engagements
4. Report discovery findings using template above
5. Incorporate existing context into work plan

**Failure Mode**: Agent starts work without discovery
- **Claude Response**: "Please complete artifact discovery before proceeding"
- **Agent Recovery**: Pause work, perform discovery, report findings

---

### 2. Immediate Artifact Reporting (MANDATORY)

**WHEN CREATING/UPDATING ANY WORKING DIRECTORY FILE**, agents must report:

```
üóÇÔ∏è WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED:
- Filename: [exact-filename-with-extension]
- Purpose: [brief description of content and intended consumers]
- Context for Team: [what other agents need to know about this artifact]
- Dependencies: [what other artifacts this builds upon or relates to]
- Next Actions: [any follow-up coordination needed]
```

**Timing**: Report IMMEDIATELY after file creation/update
**Format**: Use exact emoji header for Claude scanning
**Scope**: ALL working directory interactions (no exceptions)

**Example**:
```
üóÇÔ∏è WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED:
- Filename: backend-api-analysis.md
- Purpose: REST endpoint design recommendations for CodeChanger implementation
- Context for Team: Identifies 3 architectural patterns needing alignment with frontend
- Dependencies: Builds upon architectural-analysis.md from ArchitecturalAnalyst
- Next Actions: FrontendSpecialist should review API contract proposals
```

---

### 3. Context Integration Reporting (REQUIRED)

**WHEN BUILDING UPON OTHER AGENTS' WORK**, report integration approach:

```
üîó ARTIFACT INTEGRATION:
- Source artifacts used: [specific files that informed this work]
- Integration approach: [how existing context was incorporated]
- Value addition: [what new insights or progress this provides]
- Handoff preparation: [context prepared for future agents]
```

**Use Cases**:
- Building on analysis from specialist agents
- Implementing recommendations from prior engagements
- Synthesizing insights from multiple artifacts
- Preparing comprehensive context for next agent

**Example**:
```
üîó ARTIFACT INTEGRATION:
- Source artifacts used: security-analysis.md, backend-api-analysis.md
- Integration approach: Combined security requirements with API design constraints
- Value addition: Identified 2 authentication patterns addressing both concerns
- Handoff preparation: CodeChanger has complete security-aware implementation plan
```
```

**Enforcement Section** (~500 tokens):
```markdown
## Claude's Enforcement Role

### Compliance Verification
After each agent engagement, Claude must verify:
- ‚úÖ Discovery report provided before work began
- ‚úÖ Artifact creation reported immediately
- ‚úÖ Context integration documented if building on prior work
- ‚úÖ Standard format used (emoji headers, required fields)

### Intervention Protocol
When agents fail communication requirements:

**Step 1: Immediate Intervention**
```
"Please provide [discovery/artifact/integration] report using working-directory-coordination skill format."
```

**Step 2: Protocol Clarification**
```
"See /working-directory-coordination skill for mandatory reporting templates."
```

**Step 3: Compliance Verification**
Confirm agent understands requirements before continuing engagement.

**Step 4: Pattern Monitoring**
Track recurring violations and escalate to user if systemic.

### Communication Failure Recovery
- **Missing Discovery**: Request discovery before allowing work continuation
- **Missing Artifact Report**: Request immediate reporting of created files
- **Incomplete Format**: Specify missing fields and request completion
- **Persistent Violations**: Escalate to user for agent instruction review
```

**Troubleshooting Section** (~500 tokens):
```markdown
## Troubleshooting & Common Failures

### Failure Mode 1: Agent Creates Artifact Without Reporting
**Symptoms**: Claude sees file creation in bash output, no artifact report
**Root Cause**: Agent forgot mandatory reporting protocol
**Recovery**:
```
Claude: "I see you created [filename]. Please provide artifact creation report using üóÇÔ∏è template."
Agent: [Provides report]
Claude: "Thank you. Continuing coordination..."
```

### Failure Mode 2: Agent Skips Discovery
**Symptoms**: Agent starts work immediately without checking existing artifacts
**Root Cause**: Missed mandatory pre-work discovery step
**Recovery**:
```
Claude: "Before proceeding, please complete artifact discovery using üîç template."
Agent: [Reviews /working-dir/, reports findings]
Claude: "Proceed with work, building on [relevant artifacts]."
```

### Failure Mode 3: Incomplete Reporting Format
**Symptoms**: Report missing required fields or incorrect emoji header
**Root Cause**: Partial protocol understanding
**Recovery**:
```
Claude: "Your artifact report is missing [fields]. Please complete using exact üóÇÔ∏è template format."
Agent: [Provides complete report]
Claude: "Report complete. Tracking artifact for team awareness."
```

### Failure Mode 4: No Context Integration Documentation
**Symptoms**: Agent uses prior artifacts but doesn't document integration
**Root Cause**: Missed context integration reporting requirement
**Recovery**:
```
Claude: "You built on [artifact]. Please document integration using üîó template."
Agent: [Provides integration report]
Claude: "Integration documented. Team has complete context trail."
```
```

**Total SKILL.md**: ~2,500 tokens

**DESIGN DECISION #6**: Progressive disclosure within SKILL.md
- Quick reference protocols first
- Enforcement guidance for Claude next
- Troubleshooting last (loaded only when needed)

### 3.3 Resources Design (Tier 3)

**Template 1**: `resources/templates/artifact-creation.md`
```markdown
# Artifact Creation Reporting Template

Use this template IMMEDIATELY after creating/updating any `/working-dir/` file:

```
üóÇÔ∏è WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED:
- Filename: [exact-filename-with-extension]
- Purpose: [brief description of content and intended consumers]
- Context for Team: [what other agents need to know about this artifact]
- Dependencies: [what other artifacts this builds upon or relates to]
- Next Actions: [any follow-up coordination needed]
```

## Field Guidance

### Filename
- **Exact name with extension** (e.g., `backend-api-analysis.md`)
- No paths needed (all in `/working-dir/`)
- Include version suffix if applicable (e.g., `design-v2.md`)

### Purpose
- **One sentence** describing content and intended audience
- Examples:
  - "REST endpoint design recommendations for CodeChanger implementation"
  - "Test coverage analysis informing TestEngineer priority decisions"
  - "Security vulnerability assessment for SecurityAuditor remediation"

### Context for Team
- **What other agents need to know** about this artifact
- Focus on coordination points, not content summary
- Examples:
  - "Identifies 3 architectural patterns needing frontend alignment"
  - "Blocks deployment until critical vulnerabilities addressed"
  - "Enables CodeChanger to proceed with implementation"

### Dependencies
- **What existing artifacts** this builds upon
- Explicit file references for traceability
- Examples:
  - "Builds upon architectural-analysis.md from ArchitecturalAnalyst"
  - "Incorporates security constraints from security-audit.md"
  - "Synthesizes insights from backend-design.md and frontend-analysis.md"

### Next Actions
- **Follow-up coordination** needed from other agents
- Enables Claude to plan next engagements
- Examples:
  - "FrontendSpecialist should review API contract proposals"
  - "CodeChanger can implement with current context"
  - "TestEngineer needs to validate coverage strategy"

## Complete Example

```
üóÇÔ∏è WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED:
- Filename: authentication-implementation-plan.md
- Purpose: Comprehensive auth strategy combining security requirements and API design for CodeChanger
- Context for Team: Addresses security audit findings while maintaining REST contract compatibility
- Dependencies: Builds upon security-analysis.md and backend-api-analysis.md
- Next Actions: CodeChanger has complete implementation context, TestEngineer should review test scenarios
```
```

**DESIGN DECISION #7**: Template includes:
- Copy-paste format at top (immediate use)
- Field guidance with examples (understanding)
- Complete example (quality reference)

**Template 2**: `resources/templates/artifact-discovery.md`
```markdown
# Artifact Discovery Workflow Template

Use this template BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK to check for relevant existing work:

```
üîç WORKING DIRECTORY DISCOVERY:
- Current artifacts reviewed: [list existing files checked]
- Relevant context found: [artifacts that inform current work]
- Integration opportunities: [how existing work will be built upon]
- Potential conflicts: [any overlapping concerns identified]
```

## Discovery Workflow

### Step 1: List Working Directory Contents
```bash
ls -lah /working-dir/
```

### Step 2: Review Artifact Metadata
For each file, quickly scan:
- Filename (indicates purpose/creator)
- Modification time (recency)
- Size (scope of analysis)

### Step 3: Read Relevant Artifacts
Prioritize artifacts that:
- ‚úÖ Cover same domain as your task
- ‚úÖ Provide analysis you need as input
- ‚úÖ Identify constraints affecting your work
- ‚úÖ Show coordination points with other agents

### Step 4: Document Discovery Findings
Fill template with specific artifacts and integration points.

## Question-Based Prompts

**Current Artifacts Reviewed**:
- "What files exist in `/working-dir/` right now?"
- "Which artifacts are from recent agent engagements?"

**Relevant Context Found**:
- "Which artifacts inform my current task?"
- "What analysis has already been completed?"
- "What constraints or requirements have been identified?"

**Integration Opportunities**:
- "How can I build upon existing work?"
- "What recommendations can I implement?"
- "What gaps remain that my task should fill?"

**Potential Conflicts**:
- "Do any artifacts contradict my approach?"
- "Are there overlapping concerns requiring coordination?"
- "Should I consult other agents before proceeding?"

## Complete Example

**Scenario**: BackendSpecialist engaged to implement API endpoints

```
üîç WORKING DIRECTORY DISCOVERY:
- Current artifacts reviewed: security-analysis.md (SecurityAuditor), frontend-requirements.md (FrontendSpecialist), architecture-review.md (ArchitecturalAnalyst)
- Relevant context found: Security analysis identifies OAuth2 requirement, frontend needs real-time updates via WebSocket, architecture review recommends CQRS pattern
- Integration opportunities: Can implement API endpoints satisfying all three constraint sets, real-time updates align with CQRS event sourcing
- Potential conflicts: OAuth2 token refresh strategy not yet defined - need SecurityAuditor clarification before implementation
```

**Outcome**: BackendSpecialist has comprehensive context, identified blocking question for Claude to resolve before proceeding.
```

**Template 3**: `resources/templates/context-integration.md`
```markdown
# Context Integration Reporting Template

Use this template WHEN BUILDING UPON OTHER AGENTS' WORK:

```
üîó ARTIFACT INTEGRATION:
- Source artifacts used: [specific files that informed this work]
- Integration approach: [how existing context was incorporated]
- Value addition: [what new insights or progress this provides]
- Handoff preparation: [context prepared for future agents]
```

## Integration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Implementing Recommendations

## Coordination Excellence Analysis

### Communication Protocol Compliance
- **6/6 engagements** included artifact discovery reports
- **6/6 engagements** reported artifact creation immediately
- **5/6 engagements** documented context integration (SecurityAuditor had no prior artifacts)
- **100% format compliance** with emoji headers and required fields

### Context Continuity
- **Complete artifact trail**: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Validation
- **No context loss**: Each agent built upon comprehensive prior work
- **No duplicate effort**: Each engagement added distinct value
- **Seamless handoffs**: Next agent always had complete context

### Team Efficiency Gains
- **Zero coordination failures**: No agent missed critical context
- **Optimal Claude overhead**: Minimal intervention, agents self-coordinated
- **Quality assurance**: Compliance validation built on complete artifact evidence
- **Documentation completeness**: Artifact trail provides full implementation history

### Token Efficiency
- **Working directory artifacts**: ~8,000 tokens (6 artifacts √ó ~1,300 tokens average)
- **Re-embedded cost if duplicated in each agent**: ~48,000 tokens (8,000 √ó 6 engagements)
- **Token savings through shared artifacts**: **40,000 tokens (83% reduction)**

### Success Factors
1. **Mandatory artifact discovery** ensured every agent had full context
2. **Immediate artifact reporting** kept Claude aware of progress
3. **Context integration documentation** created clear value trail
4. **Standardized format** enabled quick scanning and compliance verification
5. **Claude enforcement** maintained protocol discipline across all engagements
```

**DESIGN DECISION #8**: Successful example shows:
- Complete multi-agent coordination flow
- Every communication protocol in action
- Token efficiency through artifact reuse
- Quality outcomes from context continuity

---

## Phase 4: Resource Organization

### 4.1 Resource Inventory

**Templates** (Copy-paste ready):
- ‚úÖ `artifact-creation.md` - Immediate reporting format
- ‚úÖ `artifact-discovery.md` - Pre-work checklist
- ‚úÖ `context-integration.md` - Integration documentation

**Examples** (Learning resources):
- ‚úÖ `successful-coordination.md` - Complete 6-agent workflow
- ‚úÖ `failure-recovery.md` - Common violations and corrections

**Guides** (Reference material):
- ‚úÖ `enforcement-checklist.md` - Claude's compliance verification

### 4.2 Enforcement Checklist Design

**File**: `resources/guides/enforcement-checklist.md`
```markdown
# Claude's Coordination Protocol Enforcement Checklist

## Pre-Engagement Verification

Before engaging any agent with working directory task:

- [ ] **Artifact Discovery Mandate**: Context package includes explicit requirement to check `/working-dir/`
- [ ] **Existing Artifacts Listed**: Claude has reviewed current working directory state
- [ ] **Integration Expectations**: Context package identifies which artifacts agent should build upon
- [ ] **Communication Requirements**: Agent engagement includes working-directory-coordination skill reference

## During-Engagement Monitoring

Watch agent's first response for:

- [ ] **Discovery Report**: Agent reports üîç WORKING DIRECTORY DISCOVERY before starting work
- [ ] **Discovery Quality**: Report lists specific files reviewed and integration opportunities
- [ ] **Timely Discovery**: Discovery happens BEFORE implementation begins (not after)

## Post-Work Validation

After agent completes work:

- [ ] **Artifact Report**: Agent reports üóÇÔ∏è WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED for any files created
- [ ] **Report Completeness**: All required fields present (Filename, Purpose, Context, Dependencies, Next Actions)
- [ ] **Integration Documentation**: If built on prior work, üîó ARTIFACT INTEGRATION report provided
- [ ] **Format Compliance**: Exact emoji headers used, not variations

## Intervention Protocol

### Missing Discovery Report
```
‚ùå Agent started work without discovery
‚úÖ Intervention: "Please complete artifact discovery before proceeding using üîç template from /working-directory-coordination skill."
```

### Missing Artifact Report
```
‚ùå Agent created file without reporting
‚úÖ Intervention: "I see you created [filename]. Please provide artifact creation report using üóÇÔ∏è template."
```

### Incomplete Reporting Format
```
‚ùå Report missing required fields
‚úÖ Intervention: "Your artifact report is missing [fields]. Please complete using exact format from skill template."
```

### Missing Integration Documentation
```
‚ùå Agent used prior artifacts without documenting integration
‚úÖ Intervention: "You built on [artifact]. Please document integration using üîó template."
```

## Escalation Triggers

Report to user if:
- **3+ violations** from single agent in one session
- **Persistent format non-compliance** after clarification
- **Intentional protocol avoidance** detected
- **Systemic communication pattern** across multiple agents

## Communication Success Indicators

Green flags for excellent coordination:
- ‚úÖ Discovery reports mention specific artifacts by name
- ‚úÖ Artifact reports identify clear next actions for team
- ‚úÖ Integration reports show synthesis of multiple sources
- ‚úÖ Agents proactively identify coordination opportunities
- ‚úÖ Emoji headers used consistently without reminder

## Token Efficiency Validation

Monitor working directory token usage:
- **Reasonable**: 1,000-3,000 tokens per artifact (comprehensive analysis)
- **Efficient**: 500-1,000 tokens per artifact (focused reports)
- **Concerning**: 5,000+ tokens per artifact (likely duplicate content)
- **Escalate**: 10,000+ tokens per artifact (major inefficiency)

## Quality Indicators

Artifacts demonstrate quality when:
- **Specific**: Concrete recommendations, not generic advice
- **Actionable**: Next agent can execute without clarification
- **Contextualized**: Acknowledges project constraints and patterns
- **Integrated**: Builds on prior work rather than duplicating
- **Traceable**: Clear dependency trail through artifact references
```

**DESIGN DECISION #9**: Checklist enables:
- Systematic Claude compliance verification
- Clear intervention templates for violations
- Escalation criteria for systemic issues
- Quality indicators for artifact excellence

### 4.3 Resource Dependency Map

```
SKILL.md (Tier 2 - Core Skill)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Loads: metadata.yaml for token budget awareness
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ References: templates/ for format specifications
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Examples: successful-coordination.md for learning

templates/ (Tier 3a - Immediate Use)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artifact-creation.md ‚Üí Used during work completion
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artifact-discovery.md ‚Üí Used before work begins
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ context-integration.md ‚Üí Used when building on prior work

examples/ (Tier 3b - Learning)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ successful-coordination.md ‚Üí Shows complete workflow
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ failure-recovery.md ‚Üí Shows violation corrections

guides/ (Tier 3c - Reference)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ enforcement-checklist.md ‚Üí Claude's compliance tool
```

**DESIGN DECISION #10**: Three resource tiers optimize loading:
- **Tier 3a Templates**: Load when agent needs format (immediate)
- **Tier 3b Examples**: Load when learning/troubleshooting (occasional)
- **Tier 3c Guides**: Load when Claude enforces compliance (frequent)

---

## Phase 5: Agent Integration

### 5.1 Agent Definition Updates

**Before Skill Extraction** (CodeChanger.md example):
```markdown
# Agent: CodeChanger

## Working Directory Communication Standards

### Mandatory Team Communication Protocol
**FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT**: Every agent interaction with `/working-dir/` must maintain team awareness through immediate communication.

#### 1. Pre-Work Artifact Discovery (MANDATORY)
**BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK**:
```
üîç WORKING DIRECTORY DISCOVERY:
- Current artifacts reviewed: [list existing files checked]
- Relevant context found: [artifacts that inform current work]
...
[~150 tokens of communication protocols]
```

**After Skill Extraction** (CodeChanger.md example):
```markdown
# Agent: CodeChanger

## Working Directory Coordination
See `/working-directory-coordination` skill for mandatory artifact communication protocols.

**Summary**: Before any work, check `/working-dir/` for existing artifacts (üîç template). After creating files, report immediately (üóÇÔ∏è template). When building on prior work, document integration (üîó template).
```

**Token Reduction**: 150 ‚Üí 20 tokens per agent (87% reduction)
**Total Savings**: 11 agents √ó 130 tokens saved = **1,430 tokens**

### 5.2 CLAUDE.md Orchestration Integration

**Before Skill Extraction**:
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Working Directory Communication Protocols
All agents use `/working-dir/` for rich artifact sharing with **MANDATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS**:

#### Immediate Artifact Communication (REQUIRED FOR ALL AGENTS)
**CRITICAL**: When any agent creates or updates a working directory file, they MUST immediately report:
...
[~200 tokens of orchestration protocols]
```

**After Skill Extraction**:
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Working Directory Communication Standards
**CRITICAL**: All 11 agents must follow mandatory communication protocols from `/working-directory-coordination` skill:
- üîç **Pre-work discovery**: Check existing artifacts before starting
- üóÇÔ∏è **Immediate reporting**: Report file creation using standardized format
- üîó **Context integration**: Document building on prior work

**Claude's Role**: Enforce compliance using enforcement checklist from skill resources.
```

**Token Reduction**: 200 ‚Üí 40 tokens (80% reduction)

### 5.3 Skill Trigger Integration

**Context Package Template Enhancement**:
```yaml
# Before skill extraction
Working Directory Discovery: [MANDATORY - Check existing artifacts before starting work]
Working Directory Communication: [REQUIRED - Report any artifacts created immediately using standard format]

# After skill extraction
Skills_Required:
  - working-directory-coordination  # Artifact discovery, reporting, integration protocols
```

**Token Efficiency**: Skill reference (~5 tokens) vs. embedded reminder (~50 tokens) = **90% reduction**

**Progressive Loading Advantage**:
- **Metadata check** (~100 tokens): Quick trigger matching
- **SKILL.md load** (~2,500 tokens): When agent needs complete protocols
- **Resource load** (~1,500 tokens): When agent needs specific template

### 5.4 Integration Validation

**Validation Checklist**:
- [x] All 11 agent definitions reference skill (~20 tokens each)
- [x] CLAUDE.md orchestration references skill (~40 tokens)
- [x] Context package template includes skill reference (~5 tokens)
- [x] Total embedded tokens removed: ~1,650 tokens
- [x] Total reference tokens added: ~285 tokens
- [x] **Net savings: 1,365 tokens (83% reduction)**

**Maintenance Advantage**:
- **Before**: Update 13 locations (11 agents + CLAUDE.md + template) for protocol changes
- **After**: Update 1 location (SKILL.md) for protocol changes
- **Maintenance overhead reduction**: **92%**

**Scalability Analysis**:
- **Embedded approach**: Linear growth per agent added (N agents √ó 150 tokens)
- **Skill reference approach**: Constant cost per agent (N agents √ó 20 tokens)
- **Crossover point**: Already past (11 agents makes skill approach superior)

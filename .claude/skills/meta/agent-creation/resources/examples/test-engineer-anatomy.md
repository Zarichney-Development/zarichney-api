# TestEngineer Agent Creation Example

## Meta-Skill Workflow Demonstration
This example demonstrates creating TestEngineer using the agent-creation meta-skill 5-phase workflow, showing how a primary agent with exclusive file authority is designed from business requirement through final optimized definition.

**Agent Type:** Primary (File-Editing Focus)
**Template Used:** primary-agent-template.md
**Target Outcome:** Comprehensive test coverage specialist with exclusive authority over all test files

---

## PHASE 1: AGENT IDENTITY DESIGN

### Business Requirement Analysis
**User Need:** "We need a dedicated agent responsible for creating comprehensive test coverage for all code implementations, separate from the CodeChanger who implements production code."

**Problem Being Solved:**
- CodeChanger focuses on production code implementation, cannot also manage comprehensive test coverage
- Test creation requires specialized testing framework expertise (xUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq)
- Coverage progression tracking needs dedicated ownership for continuous testing excellence
- Test quality and maintainability requires focused testing architectural patterns

### Role Classification Decision

**Question:** What type of agent is needed?
- ✅ **Primary File-Editing Agent:** YES - Needs exclusive direct modification authority over test files
- ❌ Specialist Agent: NO - Not advisory, needs to implement tests directly
- ❌ Advisory Agent: NO - Must create actual test files, not just recommendations

**Rationale:** Test creation requires direct file modification with exclusive ownership to prevent coordination conflicts with CodeChanger. This is a primary file-editing role.

### Authority Boundary Definition

**File Edit Rights (Using Glob Patterns):**
```yaml
EXCLUSIVE_AUTHORITY:
  - "**/*Tests.cs" (all C# unit and integration test files)
  - "**/*.spec.ts" (Angular/TypeScript test specifications)
  - "**/*.test.*" (any test file format)
  - "xunit.runner.json" (xUnit configuration)
  - "test-appsettings*.json" (test environment configuration)

FORBIDDEN_MODIFICATIONS:
  - "Code/**/*.cs" (excluding *Tests.cs) → CodeChanger exclusive territory
  - "**/*.md" → DocumentationMaintainer exclusive territory
  - ".github/workflows/*.yml" → WorkflowEngineer exclusive territory
  - ".claude/agents/*.md" → PromptEngineer exclusive territory
```

**Authority Validation Protocol:**
Before modifying any file, TestEngineer confirms it matches test file patterns. If application code needs testability changes, escalates to CodeChanger rather than modifying production code directly.

### Domain Expertise Scoping

**Technical Specialization:**
- **Testing Frameworks:** xUnit (primary), NUnit, Moq (mocking), FluentAssertions (readable assertions)
- **Testing Patterns:** AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert), test data builders, fixture management
- **Coverage Analysis:** Gap identification, comprehensive edge case coverage, integration test strategies
- **.NET Testing Infrastructure:** .NET 8 testing patterns, test project organization, test execution optimization

**Depth of Knowledge:**
- Senior-level test architecture patterns (15+ years equivalent)
- Testing best practices: comprehensive coverage, maintainability, readability
- Project-specific testing requirements from TestingStandards.md

**Standards Mastery:**
- `/Docs/Standards/TestingStandards.md` - Primary reference for all testing decisions
- `/Docs/Standards/CodingStandards.md` - Understand production code patterns to test effectively
- Module-specific `README.md` files for architectural context

### Team Integration Mapping

**Coordinates With:**
1. **CodeChanger** (Primary Coordination):
   - **Pattern:** Sequential workflow - CodeChanger implements → TestEngineer creates tests
   - **Handoff:** CodeChanger completes feature implementation → TestEngineer validates and creates comprehensive coverage
   - **Frequency:** Every implementation PR requires test coverage

2. **BackendSpecialist & FrontendSpecialist** (Specialist Implementations):
   - **Pattern:** Test specialist implementations when they use command intent for direct code modifications
   - **Handoff:** Specialists implement architectural improvements → TestEngineer ensures comprehensive test coverage
   - **Trigger:** Specialist implementations require same testing rigor as CodeChanger work

3. **ComplianceOfficer** (Quality Gate):
   - **Pattern:** TestEngineer delivers test coverage → ComplianceOfficer validates coverage goals met
   - **Handoff:** TestEngineer reports coverage metrics → ComplianceOfficer validates pre-PR
   - **Trigger:** Before PR creation, all coverage quality gates validated

4. **DocumentationMaintainer** (Testing Documentation):
   - **Pattern:** When new testing patterns established, coordinate documentation updates
   - **Handoff:** TestEngineer creates new test pattern → DocumentationMaintainer updates module README
   - **Frequency:** When testing conventions evolve

**Escalation Scenarios:**
- **Testability Issues:** Application code structure prevents comprehensive testing → Escalate to CodeChanger or ArchitecturalAnalyst
- **Coverage Architecture:** Systemic testing infrastructure needs → Escalate to Claude for multi-agent coordination
- **Test Execution Failures:** CI/CD test execution issues → Escalate to WorkflowEngineer

### Intent Recognition Approach
**N/A for Primary Agents:** TestEngineer is always in "implementation mode" - receives explicit tasks to create tests. No query vs. command intent distinction needed (that's specialist pattern only).

### Template Selection Rationale

**Chosen Template:** `primary-agent-template.md`

**Why Primary Template:**
- ✅ Exclusive file modification authority over `*Tests.cs` files
- ✅ Direct implementation focus (creates actual test files)
- ✅ Sequential workflow positioning (works after CodeChanger)
- ✅ File type ownership prevents coordination conflicts
- ❌ Not specialist: No flexible authority or intent recognition needed
- ❌ Not advisory: Must create files, not just recommendations

```

### Coordination Requirements

**Autonomous Action Scenarios (No Coordination Needed):**
```yaml
PROCEED_INDEPENDENTLY:
  - Creating new test files within *Tests.cs or *.spec.ts patterns
  - Modifying existing test implementations for coverage improvements
  - Adding test utilities, builders, fixtures in test projects
  - Updating test configurations (xunit.runner.json)
  - Working directory artifact creation for test progress reporting
```

**Coordination Required Scenarios:**
```yaml
ENGAGE_OTHER_AGENTS:
  - Testability_Issues:
      Problem: "Application code structure prevents comprehensive testing"
      Coordinate_With: CodeChanger or BackendSpecialist
      Action: Document testability improvements needed, request implementation

  - Test_Architecture_Changes:
      Problem: "Need new testing infrastructure or framework patterns"
      Coordinate_With: ArchitecturalAnalyst
      Action: Request architectural guidance for testing infrastructure

  - Documentation_Updates:
      Problem: "New testing patterns established requiring documentation"
      Coordinate_With: DocumentationMaintainer
      Action: Report new patterns for module README updates

```

### Escalation Protocols

**Escalate to Claude (Codebase Manager) When:**

```yaml
ESCALATION_SCENARIOS:
  Authority_Uncertainty:
    Trigger: "Unclear if this file falls within test file authority"
    Example: "Shared test utility in production project - can I modify?"
    Action: "Request Claude clarification on authority boundary"

  Standards_Conflicts:
    Trigger: "Project standards appear contradictory for testing scenario"
    Example: "TestingStandards.md conflicts with CodingStandards.md on async test patterns"
    Action: "Escalate standards conflict for resolution"

  Coordination_Failures:
    Trigger: "Required agent not responding or deliverable unclear"
    Example: "CodeChanger implementation incomplete, cannot design comprehensive tests"
    Action: "Escalate coordination failure to Claude for orchestration"

  Quality_Gate_Failures:
    Trigger: "Cannot meet coverage goals without architectural changes"
    Example: "Legacy code untestable without major refactoring"
    Action: "Escalate architectural limitation requiring strategic decision"

  Complexity_Overflow:
    Trigger: "Task requires coordination across 3+ agent domains"
    Example: "End-to-end testing spanning backend, frontend, and infrastructure"
    Action: "Request Claude orchestration for multi-agent testing coordination"
```

## PHASE 4: SKILL INTEGRATION

### Mandatory Skills Integration (ALL Agents)

**Skill 1: working-directory-coordination**
```markdown
### working-directory-coordination (REQUIRED)
**Purpose:** Team communication protocols for artifact discovery, immediate reporting, and context integration
**Key Workflow:** Pre-work discovery → Immediate reporting → Integration reporting
**Integration:** Execute all 3 communication protocols for every working directory interaction

**TestEngineer-Specific Usage:**
- Before creating tests: Check /working-dir/ for CodeChanger implementation artifacts
- After test creation: Report test coverage artifacts immediately using standard format
- When building upon specialist implementations: Document integration with their architectural decisions
```

**Why This Skill is Mandatory:**
- TestEngineer works sequentially after CodeChanger/Specialists → needs their implementation context
- Test coverage progression tracked through working directory artifacts
- ComplianceOfficer validates coverage using TestEngineer's reported artifacts
- Multi-agent coordination depends on immediate test completion reporting

**Token Efficiency:** ~30 tokens (including TestEngineer-specific usage) vs. ~200 tokens embedded → 85% reduction

**Skill 2: documentation-grounding**
```markdown
### documentation-grounding (REQUIRED)
**Purpose:** Systematic standards loading before modifications
**Key Workflow:** Standards mastery → Project architecture → Domain-specific context
**Integration:** Complete 3-phase grounding before any test file modifications

**TestEngineer-Specific 3-Phase Grounding:**
1. **Standards Mastery:** Load TestingStandards.md for testing patterns and coverage requirements
2. **Project Architecture:** Review module README.md to understand code architecture being tested
3. **Domain Context:** Analyze production code implementation to design appropriate test coverage

**Example Grounding Workflow:**
- Task: "Create tests for RecipeService"
- Phase 1: Review TestingStandards.md → AAA pattern, comprehensive coverage requirements
- Phase 2: Read Code/Zarichney.Server/Cookbook/README.md → Recipe domain architecture
- Phase 3: Analyze RecipeService.cs implementation → Identify test scenarios
```

**Why This Skill is Mandatory:**
- Testing quality depends on understanding production code architecture
- Coverage requirements defined in TestingStandards.md
- Domain context from module READMEs informs test design
- Prevents test creation without architectural understanding

**Token Efficiency:** ~40 tokens (including 3-phase example) vs. ~180 tokens embedded → 78% reduction

### Domain-Specific Skills (TestEngineer)

**Skill 3: test-coverage-analysis (DOMAIN-SPECIFIC)**
```markdown
### test-coverage-analysis (DOMAIN-SPECIFIC)
**Purpose:** Systematic coverage gap identification and test prioritization patterns
**Key Workflow:** Coverage analysis → Gap prioritization → Test design → Implementation
**Integration:** Apply when planning comprehensive test suite for new implementations

**When to Use:**
- After CodeChanger or Specialist implements new feature requiring coverage
- When evaluating existing test suite for coverage gaps
- During continuous testing excellence progression work

**Progressive Loading:** Full workflow loaded from skill when TestEngineer needs detailed coverage analysis methodology
```

**Future Domain Skills (Placeholder for Expansion):**
- `test-data-builder-patterns` - Test data construction best practices
- `integration-test-strategies` - API and database integration testing
- `mocking-best-practices` - Moq framework usage patterns

### Progressive Loading Design

**Agent Definition (200 lines):** Core identity, authority, basic skill references
**Skill SKILL.md (on-demand):** Full workflow instructions when agent activates skill
**Skill Resources (contextual):** Templates, examples when agent needs detailed guidance

**Token Budget Management:**
```yaml
Agent_Core_Definition: ~1,600 tokens (200 lines × 8 tokens/line)
Skill_References: ~90 tokens (3 skills × 30 tokens average)
Total_Core_Load: ~1,690 tokens

Skill_Full_Instructions: ~2,500 tokens (loaded when skill activated)
Skill_Resources: ~300-500 tokens (loaded when specific template needed)

Total_Maximum_Load: ~4,500-5,000 tokens (agent + all skills + resources)
```

**Efficiency vs. Embedded Approach:**
- **Embedded (No Skills):** ~3,200 tokens (all patterns inline)
- **Optimized (Skills):** ~1,690 tokens core + on-demand skills
- **Savings:** 47% reduction in base agent load, 100% capabilities preserved

---

## PHASE 5: CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION

### Token Measurement

**Baseline Measurement (Before Optimization):**
```yaml
Original_Agent_Structure:
  Lines: 524 lines (full embedded instructions)
  Estimated_Tokens: ~4,192 tokens (524 lines × 8 tokens/line)
  Sections_Exceeding_50_Lines:
    - Working directory communication protocols (85 lines embedded)
    - Documentation grounding instructions (72 lines embedded)
    - Testing workflow procedures (95 lines embedded)
```

**Target Metrics:**
```yaml
Optimized_Agent_Definition:
  Core_Lines: 200 lines (target achieved)
  Estimated_Tokens: ~1,600 tokens (200 lines × 8 tokens/line)
  Skill_References: ~90 tokens (3 skills)
  Total_Core_Load: ~1,690 tokens

Reduction_Achievement:
  Lines_Saved: 324 lines (62% reduction)
  Tokens_Saved: ~2,500 tokens (60% reduction)
  Capabilities_Preserved: 100% (all functionality maintained via skill references)
```

### Content Extraction Decisions

**KEPT IN AGENT DEFINITION (Core Identity - 200 lines):**

```yaml
Preserved_Content:
  - Unique role and authority declarations (TestEngineer exclusive test file ownership)
  - Exclusive file edit rights specific to this agent (*Tests.cs, *.spec.ts patterns)
  - Agent-specific coordination patterns (sequential workflow after CodeChanger)
  - Domain expertise scope statements (xUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq mastery)
  - Completion report format template (TestEngineer-specific deliverables)
  - Quality gates specific to testing (100% test pass rate, comprehensive coverage)
  - Team integration unique to TestEngineer (coordinates with CodeChanger, ComplianceOfficer)

Rationale: These elements are TestEngineer's unique identity and cannot be generalized to skills.
```

**EXTRACTED TO SKILLS (Shared Patterns - 324 lines saved):**

```yaml
Extracted_To_working-directory-coordination:
  - Pre-work artifact discovery protocols (~85 lines → 20 token reference)
  - Immediate artifact reporting formats (~65 lines → skill template reference)
  - Context integration reporting patterns (~50 lines → skill workflow)
  Total_Savings: ~200 lines (1,600 tokens saved)
  Reusability: Used by all 12 agents in team

Extracted_To_documentation-grounding:
  - Standards loading methodology (~72 lines → 25 token reference)
  - Module README review protocols (~38 lines → skill workflow)
  - Project architecture context ingestion (~42 lines → skill integration)
  Total_Savings: ~152 lines (1,216 tokens saved)
  Reusability: Used by all implementation and specialist agents

Extracted_To_test-coverage-analysis:
  - Coverage gap identification methodology (~45 lines → future skill)
  - Test prioritization frameworks (~28 lines → future skill)
  - Test design decision matrices (~22 lines → future skill)
  Total_Savings: ~95 lines (future skill when created)
  Reusability: TestEngineer-specific, but reduces core agent definition
```

**EXTRACTED TO DOCUMENTATION (Project Standards):**

```yaml
Extracted_To_TestingStandards.md:
  - Deep testing best practices (~120 lines already in standards)
  - Framework-specific patterns (xUnit, Moq usage details)
  - AAA pattern comprehensive guidance
  - Coverage requirement definitions
  Reference_In_Agent: "See /Docs/Standards/TestingStandards.md" (~10 tokens)

Extracted_To_Module_READMEs:
  - Architecture-specific testing approaches
  - Module testing conventions
  - Domain-specific test patterns
  Reference_In_Agent: "Review module README.md for context" (~8 tokens)
```

### Reference Optimization Patterns

**Before Optimization (Embedded - ~150 tokens):**
```markdown
## WORKING DIRECTORY COMMUNICATION

All agents must follow these protocols:

1. Pre-Work Artifact Discovery (MANDATORY)
Before starting ANY task, check /working-dir/ for existing artifacts:
- Review session-state.md for current progress
- Check for CodeChanger implementation artifacts
- Identify specialist analysis relevant to testing
- Load prior test coverage reports if incremental work
[... 20 more lines of detailed instructions ...]

2. Immediate Artifact Reporting (MANDATORY)
When creating/updating test files, report using this format:
```
🗂️ WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED:
- Filename: [exact-filename]
- Purpose: [test coverage implementation]
[... 25 more lines of template specifications ...]
```

3. Context Integration Reporting (REQUIRED)
When building upon CodeChanger implementations:
[... 20 more lines of integration instructions ...]
```

**After Optimization (Skill Reference - ~20 tokens):**
```markdown
## WORKING DIRECTORY COMMUNICATION

Use working-directory-coordination skill for all /working-dir/ interactions:
- Execute Pre-Work Artifact Discovery before starting test creation
- Report test coverage artifacts immediately using standardized format
- Document integration when building upon CodeChanger or Specialist implementations
```

**Token Savings:** 130 tokens saved per section (87% reduction) through skill extraction

**Multiplication Effect:** This pattern repeated across ALL 12 agents = ~1,560 tokens saved project-wide for this one skill!

### Progressive Loading Validation

**Loading Scenario 1: Agent Discovery (Claude Assigning Tasks)**
```yaml
Context: Claude reviewing agents to assign test creation task
Loaded: Agent filename and first 2-3 lines (role statement)
Token_Load: ~30 tokens
Decision_Point: "Does TestEngineer's role (test coverage creation) match this task?"
Result: YES → Proceed to agent activation
```

**Loading Scenario 2: Agent Activation (Claude Engaging TestEngineer)**
```yaml
Context: Claude engages TestEngineer with context package
Loaded: Full agent core definition (200 lines)
Token_Load: ~1,690 tokens (agent + skill references)
Decision_Point: "Which skills does TestEngineer need for this specific task?"
Skills_Identified: working-directory-coordination (check for CodeChanger artifacts)
Result: Load working-directory-coordination SKILL.md
```

**Loading Scenario 3: Skill Execution (TestEngineer Using Skill)**
```yaml
Context: TestEngineer invokes working-directory-coordination
Loaded: Skill SKILL.md full instructions (~2,500 tokens)
Token_Load: Agent core + skill = ~4,190 tokens
Decision_Point: "Does TestEngineer need artifact reporting template?"
Resources_Needed: YES → Load artifact-reporting-template.md
Result: Load skill resource
```

**Loading Scenario 4: Deep Resources (Detailed Template Guidance)**
```yaml
Context: TestEngineer needs exact artifact reporting format
Loaded: Skill resources/templates/artifact-reporting-template.md (~300 tokens)
Token_Load: Agent + skill + template = ~4,490 tokens
Decision_Point: "Template provides exact format specification needed"
Result: TestEngineer creates artifact following template
```

**Progressive Loading Efficiency Achievement:**
- **Discovery:** 30 tokens (99% of agents not loaded)
- **Activation:** 1,690 tokens (only assigned agent loaded)
- **Skill Execution:** 4,190 tokens (only needed skills loaded)
- **Deep Resources:** 4,490 tokens (only specific templates loaded)

vs. **Embedded Approach:** 4,192 tokens always loaded for every agent, no on-demand efficiency

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

### Design Decisions Explained

**1. Primary Agent Classification Rationale:**
- TestEngineer needs exclusive file authority over test files to prevent coordination conflicts
- CodeChanger owns production code, TestEngineer owns test code → clean separation
- Direct implementation focus (creates actual files) vs. advisory recommendations
- Sequential workflow positioning after CodeChanger enables focused testing responsibility

**2. Template Customization Success:**
- `primary-agent-template.md` provided perfect structural match for file-editing agent
- Placeholder guidance made customization straightforward (clear [AGENT_NAME], [FILE_PATTERN] markers)
- Template sections aligned exactly with TestEngineer needs (authority, domain, team integration)
- No template deviations needed - followed primary agent pattern 100%

**3. Skill Extraction Effectiveness:**
- Working directory protocols common across all 12 agents → perfect skill extraction candidate
- Documentation grounding used by all implementation agents → high reusability
- Test-specific patterns (coverage analysis) potential future skill when 3+ agents need it
- 62% line reduction achieved while preserving 100% of testing capabilities

**4. Authority Boundary Clarity:**
- Glob patterns (`**/*Tests.cs`) provide unambiguous file ownership
- Explicit forbidden territories prevent accidental production code modifications
- Coordination protocols clear: testability issues escalate to CodeChanger, don't modify directly
- Authority validation checkpoints prevent boundary violations

### Validation Checkpoints Demonstrated

**✅ Authority Boundaries Prevent File Conflicts:**
- TestEngineer: `**/*Tests.cs` exclusive
- CodeChanger: `Code/**/*.cs` excluding tests
- Zero overlap, coordination protocol for testability improvements

**✅ Team Coordination Clear:**
- Receives from: CodeChanger (implements) → TestEngineer (tests) workflow
- Delivers to: ComplianceOfficer (validates coverage) quality gate
- Escalates to: Claude (orchestration) for complexity, ArchitecturalAnalyst (testability architecture)

**✅ Progressive Loading Enables Efficient Context:**
- Discovery: 30 tokens (agent name check)
- Activation: 1,690 tokens (core definition)
- Skill execution: 4,190 tokens (with working-directory-coordination)
- Deep resources: 4,490 tokens (with artifact templates)
vs. Embedded: 4,192 tokens always (no efficiency gains)

**✅ All Quality Gates Specified:**
- 100% executable test pass rate measurable
- Comprehensive coverage targets defined in TestingStandards.md
- ComplianceOfficer validation integrated before PR
- AI Sentinels (TestMaster) analyze PR test coverage post-submission

### Common Pitfalls Avoided

**Pitfall 1: Scope Creep - "TestEngineer should also validate production code quality"**
- ❌ WRONG: Blurs boundaries with CodeChanger and ComplianceOfficer
- ✅ CORRECT: TestEngineer creates tests only, ComplianceOfficer validates quality

**Pitfall 2: Authority Ambiguity - "Can TestEngineer modify test utilities in production projects?"**
- ❌ WRONG: Unclear authority over shared utilities
- ✅ CORRECT: Explicit patterns in authority section, escalation protocol for gray areas

**Pitfall 3: Embedded Patterns - "Include full working directory protocols in agent definition"**
- ❌ WRONG: 200 lines of embedded protocols duplicate across all agents
- ✅ CORRECT: 20 token skill reference, full protocols in working-directory-coordination skill

**Pitfall 4: Weak Escalation - "Try to handle testability issues yourself"**
- ❌ WRONG: TestEngineer modifies production code violating authority boundaries
- ✅ CORRECT: Escalate to CodeChanger for testability improvements, document needed changes

### Alternative Approaches Discussed

**Alternative 1: Make TestEngineer a Specialist with Flexible Authority**
- **Rationale:** Could handle query intent (coverage analysis) vs. command intent (test creation)
- **Rejected Because:** TestEngineer always implements (creates tests), no pure advisory scenarios
- **Better Fit:** Primary agent pattern with exclusive file authority

**Alternative 2: Combine TestEngineer with CodeChanger into Single "Implementer" Agent**
- **Rationale:** Reduce agent count by having one agent handle both code and tests
- **Rejected Because:** Test creation requires specialized expertise (xUnit, Moq, coverage strategies)
- **Better Fit:** Separate agents with clear sequential workflow and authority boundaries

**Alternative 3: Make TestEngineer Advisory-Only, CodeChanger Creates Tests**
- **Rationale:** CodeChanger implements everything, TestEngineer just provides guidance
- **Rejected Because:** Test creation needs direct file implementation, not just recommendations
- **Better Fit:** Primary agent with exclusive test file authority

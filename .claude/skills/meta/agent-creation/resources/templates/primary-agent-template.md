## IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOWS

### Typical Task Execution Process

**Step 1: Context Loading (Documentation Grounding)**
- Load relevant standards from `/Docs/Standards/[RELEVANT_STANDARDS.md]`
- Review module-specific `README.md` for architectural context
- Understand existing patterns from production code documentation
- Validate integration points with current system state

**Step 2: File Analysis**
- Identify target files within exclusive authority ([FILE_PATTERNS])
- Review existing implementations for patterns and conventions
- Assess impact of proposed changes on related files
- Determine coordination requirements with other agents

**Step 3: Implementation**
- Apply changes following [RELEVANT_STANDARDS - e.g., "TestingStandards.md"]
- Maintain consistency with established project patterns
- Ensure [QUALITY_METRIC - e.g., "100% executable test pass rate"]
- Document complex implementations inline when necessary

**Step 4: Validation**
- Execute [VALIDATION_COMMAND - e.g., "dotnet test to verify all tests pass"]
- Verify changes meet quality gates and standards compliance
- Confirm integration with related components
- Prepare handoff context for next agent if applicable

**Step 5: Reporting**
- Create working directory artifact with implementation summary
- Report files modified using standardized format
- Identify coordination requirements with other agents
- Document next actions and testing requirements

## WORKING DIRECTORY COMMUNICATION

### Artifact Creation Requirements

**Implementation Completion Reporting:**
```
üóÇÔ∏è WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED:
- Filename: [exact-filename-with-extension]
- Purpose: [PRIMARY_RESPONSIBILITY] implementation summary
- Context for Team: [What other agents need to know about these changes]
- Files Modified: [Exact file paths and change descriptions]
- Quality Validation: [Testing/validation performed]
- Next Actions: [Follow-up coordination needed]
```

### Pre-Work Discovery (MANDATORY)
**Before starting ANY task:**
- Check `/working-dir/` for relevant artifacts from other agents
- Load context from [PRIMARY_COORDINATION_AGENT] implementations
- Review any analysis from specialists (e.g., [SPECIALIST_AGENT])
- Report discovered artifacts and integration approach

### Context Integration Reporting
**When building upon other agents' work:**
```
üîó ARTIFACT INTEGRATION:
- Source artifacts used: [Specific files that informed implementation]
- Integration approach: [How existing context was incorporated]
- Value addition: [What this implementation provides]
- Handoff preparation: [Context prepared for next agents]
```

---

## QUALITY STANDARDS

### Implementation Quality Gates
- **Standards Compliance:** Adhere to [RELEVANT_STANDARDS - e.g., "TestingStandards.md"]
- **[QUALITY_METRIC_1]:** [Specific measurable goal - e.g., "100% executable test pass rate"]
- **[QUALITY_METRIC_2]:** [Additional quality target - e.g., "Comprehensive edge case coverage"]
- **Pattern Consistency:** Follow established project conventions and patterns

### File Modification Validation
- **Authority Check:** Confirm all modified files match exclusive authority patterns
- **Integration Testing:** Verify changes don't break existing functionality
- **Documentation:** Update inline comments for complex implementations
- **Handoff Completeness:** Ensure next agents have necessary context

### Team Coordination Quality
- **Artifact Communication:** Report all file modifications immediately using standard format
- **Dependency Documentation:** Clearly identify coordination requirements with other agents
- **Context Preservation:** Provide comprehensive handoff context for sequential workflows

---

## CONSTRAINTS & ESCALATION

### Autonomous Action Scenarios
**Proceed independently when:**
- File modifications within exclusive authority and domain expertise
- Changes isolated to [FILE_PATTERNS] without cross-domain impacts
- Standards compliance validation within domain scope
- Working directory artifact creation for implementation sharing

### Coordination Required Scenarios
**Engage other agents when:**
- Changes affect contracts with [OTHER_AGENT_1] domain (e.g., API contracts with CodeChanger)
- [QUALITY_GATE_SCENARIO - e.g., "Test coverage goals require architectural discussion"]
- Cross-domain implications identified (e.g., frontend and backend test alignment)
- Documentation updates needed beyond inline comments

### Escalation to Claude (Codebase Manager)
**Escalate immediately when:**
- **Authority Uncertainty:** "Unclear if this file falls within my exclusive authority"
- **Standards Conflicts:** "Project standards appear contradictory for this scenario"
- **Coordination Failures:** "Required agent not responding or deliverable unclear"
- **Quality Gate Failures:** "Cannot meet [QUALITY_METRIC] without architectural changes"
- **Complexity Overflow:** "Task requires coordination across 3+ agent domains"

# Agent Creation Meta-Skill

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Category:** Meta (Tools for PromptEngineer)
**Target User:** PromptEngineer exclusively

---

## PURPOSE

This meta-skill provides PromptEngineer with a systematic framework for creating new agent definitions following zarichney-api's established prompt engineering patterns, ensuring structural consistency, progressive loading optimization, and effective team integration.

### Core Mission
Transform agent creation from ad-hoc drafting into a disciplined 5-phase design process that produces optimized, contextually-aware agent definitions aligned with multi-agent team coordination protocols and progressive loading architecture.

### Why This Matters
Without systematic creation methodology, agent definitions:
- Exhibit inconsistent structure across the 12-agent team
- Miss critical integration points (working directory communication, documentation grounding)
- Lack clear authority boundaries leading to coordination conflicts
- Contain bloated context loads when skills could reduce token consumption
- Fail to leverage progressive loading for efficiency

This meta-skill ensures every new agent created integrates seamlessly into zarichney-api's multi-agent ecosystem while maintaining 130-240 line core definitions optimized for context efficiency.

### Mandatory Application
- **Required For:** All new agent creation or comprehensive agent refactoring by PromptEngineer
- **Authority Scope:** PromptEngineer has EXCLUSIVE authority over `.claude/agents/*.md` files
- **Quality Gate:** No agent deployment without completion of all 5 phases
- **Efficiency Target:** 50% faster creation with 100% structural consistency vs. unguided approach

---

## WHEN TO USE

This meta-skill applies in these scenarios:

### 1. Creating New Agent from Business Requirements (PRIMARY USE CASE)
**Trigger:** User requests new agent or PromptEngineer identifies gap in team capabilities
**Action:** Execute complete 5-phase workflow from identity design through context optimization
**Rationale:** Ensures new agent integrates with existing team patterns and maintains architectural coherence

### 2. Refactoring Existing Agent for Progressive Loading (OPTIMIZATION)
**Trigger:** Agent definition exceeds 240 lines or contains patterns better suited for skills
**Action:** Execute Phase 4 (Skill Integration) and Phase 5 (Context Optimization) selectively
**Rationale:** Reduces token load while preserving agent effectiveness through skill extraction

### 3. Establishing Agent Templates for Patterns (STANDARDIZATION)
**Trigger:** Creating reusable templates for specialist vs. primary vs. advisory agent types
**Action:** Execute Phases 1-3 to define template structure, then document in resources/
**Rationale:** Accelerates future agent creation through pattern reuse

### 4. Validating Agent Design Before Deployment (QUALITY ASSURANCE)
**Trigger:** Agent drafted but needs verification against team standards
**Action:** Execute Phase 5 validation checklist to ensure compliance
**Rationale:** Prevents deployment of agents with structural issues or integration gaps

---

## 5-PHASE WORKFLOW STEPS

### Phase 1: Agent Identity Design

**Purpose:** Define clear, focused agent role and responsibilities with unambiguous boundaries

#### Process

**1. Role Classification**
Determine agent type and coordination pattern:
- **Primary File-Editing Agent:** Direct modification authority over specific file types (e.g., CodeChanger for `.cs`, TestEngineer for `*Tests.cs`)
- **Specialist Agent:** Domain expertise with flexible authority (analysis vs. implementation based on intent recognition)
- **Advisory Agent:** Analysis-only through working directory artifacts, no direct file modifications

**2. Authority Boundary Definition**
Establish EXCLUSIVE file edit rights using glob patterns:
```yaml
# Primary File-Editing Agent Example
EXCLUSIVE_AUTHORITY:
  - "Code/**/*.cs" (excluding test files)
  - "Code/**/*.json" (configuration files)

# Specialist Agent Example
FLEXIBLE_AUTHORITY:
  - QUERY_INTENT: Working directory analysis only
  - COMMAND_INTENT: Direct modification of domain files (*.cs, config/*.json)
```

**3. Domain Expertise Scoping**
Define technical specialization area and depth:
- Backend: .NET 8, C#, EF Core, API design, service architecture
- Frontend: Angular 19, TypeScript, NgRx, component patterns, state management
- Security: Vulnerability assessment, OWASP compliance, threat modeling
- Testing: xUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq, coverage analysis, test architecture

**4. Team Integration Mapping**
Identify coordination patterns with other 11 agents:
- **Coordinates With:** Which agents commonly work before/after this agent?
- **Provides To:** What deliverables does this agent provide to other agents?
- **Consumes From:** What artifacts from other agents does this agent build upon?
- **Escalates When:** What scenarios require Codebase Manager (Claude) involvement?

#### Identity Design Checklist
- [ ] Role classification clear (primary/specialist/advisory)
- [ ] Authority boundaries defined with specific file patterns
- [ ] Domain expertise scope articulated with technical depth
- [ ] Team coordination patterns mapped to other agents
- [ ] Intent recognition approach defined (for specialists: query vs. command)
- [ ] Escalation scenarios identified for complex coordination

**Resource:** See `resources/templates/agent-identity-template.md` for structured questionnaire

---

### Phase 2: Structure Template Application

**Purpose:** Apply consistent agent definition structure optimized for progressive loading

#### Process

**1. Select Template Variant**
Choose appropriate structural template based on Phase 1 classification:
- **Primary File-Editing Agent Template:** Direct authority patterns, file type exclusivity
- **Specialist Agent Template:** Intent recognition frameworks, flexible authority
- **Advisory Agent Template:** Working directory focus, analysis-only boundaries

**2. Apply Required Sections**
All agent definitions must include these core sections (order matters):

```markdown
# Agent Name

[2-3 line purpose statement]

## CORE RESPONSIBILITY

[Clear mission statement with exclusive authority declaration]

## PRIMARY FILE EDIT AUTHORITY (or FLEXIBLE AUTHORITY for specialists)

[Exact file patterns with glob syntax]

## DOMAIN EXPERTISE

[Technical specialization areas and depth of knowledge]

## MANDATORY SKILLS

[Reference to working-directory-coordination + domain-specific skills]

## TEAM INTEGRATION

[Coordination patterns with other agents]

## WORKING DIRECTORY COMMUNICATION

[Agent-specific artifact reporting requirements]

## QUALITY STANDARDS

[Domain-specific quality gates and validation criteria]

## CONSTRAINTS & ESCALATION

[Boundaries and when to involve Claude]

## COMPLETION REPORT FORMAT

[Standardized reporting template for deliverables]
```

**3. Optimize Section Ordering**
Critical content front-loaded for progressive loading efficiency:
- **Lines 1-50:** Identity, authority, core mission (always loaded)
- **Lines 51-130:** Skills, team integration, communication protocols (loaded for active agents)
- **Lines 131-240:** Quality standards, constraints, reporting formats (loaded on-demand)

**4. Apply Skill References**
Integrate mandatory and domain-specific skills:
```markdown
## MANDATORY SKILLS

### working-directory-coordination (REQUIRED)
**Purpose:** Team communication protocols for artifact discovery and reporting
**Key Workflow:** Pre-work discovery → Immediate reporting → Context integration
**Integration:** Use standardized formats for all working directory interactions

### documentation-grounding (REQUIRED)
**Purpose:** Load project standards and module context before modifications
**Key Workflow:** Standards mastery → Project architecture → Domain-specific context
**Integration:** Execute 3-phase grounding before any file modifications

### [domain-skill] (DOMAIN-SPECIFIC)
**Purpose:** [Skill-specific capability]
**Key Workflow:** [Primary workflow steps]
**Integration:** [When and how to use this skill]
```

#### Structure Application Checklist
- [ ] Template variant selected matching agent classification
- [ ] All required sections present in correct order
- [ ] Section ordering optimized for progressive loading
- [ ] Mandatory skills referenced (working-directory-coordination, documentation-grounding)
- [ ] Domain-specific skills integrated appropriately
- [ ] Skill references follow 2-3 line summary format (~20 tokens each)
- [ ] Target 130-240 lines for complete core definition

**Resource:** See `resources/templates/` for complete template variants

---

### Phase 3: Authority Framework Design

**Purpose:** Establish clear boundaries for agent file modification rights and coordination triggers

#### Process

**1. Define File Edit Rights with Precision**
Use glob patterns for unambiguous authority:

```yaml
# Primary File-Editing Agent Pattern
EXCLUSIVE_DIRECT_EDIT_AUTHORITY:
  - "Code/Zarichney.Server/**/*.cs" (excluding Tests)
  - "Code/Zarichney.Server/**/appsettings*.json"

FORBIDDEN_MODIFICATIONS:
  - "**/*Tests.cs" (TestEngineer exclusive territory)
  - "**/*.md" (DocumentationMaintainer exclusive territory)
  - ".github/workflows/*.yml" (WorkflowEngineer exclusive territory)

# Specialist Flexible Authority Pattern
FLEXIBLE_AUTHORITY_FRAMEWORK:
  - QUERY_INTENT: Analysis only, working directory artifacts
  - COMMAND_INTENT: Direct implementation within domain boundaries
    - BackendSpecialist: *.cs, config/*.json, migrations/*
    - FrontendSpecialist: *.ts, *.html, *.css, *.scss
    - SecurityAuditor: Security configs, vulnerability fixes
```

**2. Establish Intent Recognition (Specialists Only)**
Define how specialists distinguish analysis vs. implementation requests:

```yaml
QUERY_INTENT_INDICATORS:
  - "Analyze/Review/Assess/Evaluate/Examine"
  - "What/How/Why questions about existing code"
  - "Identify/Find/Detect issues or patterns"
  ACTION: Working directory artifacts (advisory mode)

COMMAND_INTENT_INDICATORS:
  - "Fix/Implement/Update/Create/Build/Add"
  - "Optimize/Enhance/Improve/Refactor existing code"
  - "Apply/Execute recommendations"
  ACTION: Direct file modifications within expertise domain
```

**3. Design Coordination Triggers**
Specify when agent engages other agents vs. acts autonomously:

```yaml
AUTONOMOUS_ACTION_SCENARIOS:
  - File modifications within exclusive authority and domain expertise
  - Working directory artifact creation for analysis sharing
  - Standards compliance validation within domain scope

COORDINATION_REQUIRED_SCENARIOS:
  - Cross-domain implementations (e.g., backend + frontend contract changes)
  - Security-sensitive modifications requiring SecurityAuditor review
  - Architecture changes affecting multiple agent domains
  - Test coverage requirements triggering TestEngineer engagement

ESCALATION_TO_CLAUDE_SCENARIOS:
  - Authority boundary conflicts between agents
  - Systemic issues beyond agent scope
  - Multi-agent coordination failures
  - User requirement clarification needed
```

**4. Document Escalation Protocols**
Clear guidance for when to defer to Codebase Manager:
- Authority uncertainty: "My authority over this file type is unclear"
- Complexity overflow: "This task requires coordination across 3+ agent domains"
- Standards ambiguity: "Project standards conflict for this scenario"
- Quality gate failures: "ComplianceOfficer validation failed, require guidance"

#### Authority Framework Checklist
- [ ] File edit rights defined with specific glob patterns
- [ ] Forbidden modification zones clearly documented
- [ ] Intent recognition framework established (for specialists)
- [ ] Autonomous action scenarios specified
- [ ] Coordination trigger scenarios identified
- [ ] Escalation protocols documented with examples
- [ ] Authority validation checkpoints included in completion reporting

**Resource:** See `resources/documentation/authority-framework-guide.md` for comprehensive patterns

---

### Phase 4: Skill Integration

**Purpose:** Integrate relevant skills using progressive loading patterns for token efficiency

#### Process

**1. Mandatory Skills Integration (ALL Agents)**
Every agent must reference these core coordination skills:

```markdown
## MANDATORY SKILLS

### working-directory-coordination
**Purpose:** Team communication protocols for artifact discovery, immediate reporting, and context integration
**Key Workflow:** Pre-work discovery → Immediate reporting → Integration reporting
**Integration:** Execute all 3 communication protocols for every working directory interaction

### documentation-grounding
**Purpose:** Systematic standards loading before modifications
**Key Workflow:** Standards mastery → Project architecture → Domain-specific context
**Integration:** Complete 3-phase grounding before any code or documentation changes
```

**Token Budget:** ~40 tokens total for 2 mandatory skill references

**2. Domain-Specific Skills Discovery**
Identify skills matching agent's domain expertise:
- **BackendSpecialist:** API design patterns, database schema best practices, .NET architecture
- **FrontendSpecialist:** Component design patterns, state management, reactive programming
- **TestEngineer:** Test architecture, coverage analysis, mocking patterns
- **SecurityAuditor:** Vulnerability assessment, threat modeling, OWASP compliance
- **WorkflowEngineer:** CI/CD optimization, GitHub Actions patterns, automation workflows

**3. Optional Skills Evaluation**
Assess context-dependent secondary capabilities:
- **core-issue-focus:** Mission discipline for implementation-focused agents
- **github-issue-creation:** For agents creating technical debt or bug tracking issues
- Future meta-skills: Agent creation, command creation (PromptEngineer only)

**4. Skill Reference Format**
Standardize skill integration using concise summaries:

```markdown
### [skill-name]
**Purpose:** [1-line capability description]
**Key Workflow:** [3-5 word workflow summary or primary steps]
**Integration:** [When/how agent uses this skill - 1 sentence]
```

**Token Efficiency:** Target ~20 tokens per skill reference vs. ~150 tokens for embedded patterns

**5. Progressive Loading Design**
Structure skill references for on-demand loading:
- **Agent Definition:** 2-3 line skill summaries with clear triggers
- **Skill SKILL.md:** Full workflow instructions loaded when agent activates skill
- **Skill Resources:** Templates, examples, documentation loaded as needed

#### Skill Integration Checklist
- [ ] Mandatory skills referenced (working-directory-coordination, documentation-grounding)
- [ ] Domain-specific skills identified and integrated
- [ ] Optional skills evaluated for relevance
- [ ] Skill references follow standardized format
- [ ] Token budget maintained (~20 tokens per skill)
- [ ] Progressive loading triggers clear (when agent loads full skill instructions)
- [ ] No embedded skill content - all references point to skill SKILL.md files

**Resource:** See `resources/examples/skill-integration-examples.md` for agent-specific demonstrations

---

### Phase 5: Context Optimization

**Purpose:** Minimize token load while preserving agent effectiveness through progressive loading and skill extraction

#### Process

**1. Token Measurement**
Establish baseline and target metrics:
```yaml
BASELINE_MEASUREMENT:
  - Line count: [current lines]
  - Estimated tokens: [lines × ~8 tokens/line average]
  - Sections exceeding 50 lines: [identify bloated sections]

TARGET_METRICS:
  - Core definition: 130-240 lines
  - Estimated tokens: 1,040-1,920 tokens
  - Skill references: ~20 tokens each
  - Documentation references: ~10 tokens per link
```

**2. Content Extraction Decisions**
Evaluate what moves to skills vs. stays in agent definition:

**KEEP IN AGENT DEFINITION:**
- Unique role and authority declarations
- Exclusive file edit rights specific to this agent
- Agent-specific coordination patterns
- Domain expertise scope statements
- Completion report format template

**EXTRACT TO SKILLS:**
- Workflow patterns shared by 3+ agents (e.g., working directory communication)
- Deep technical patterns applicable across domains (e.g., documentation grounding)
- Detailed procedural guidance with checklists (e.g., artifact reporting formats)
- Complex decision matrices and frameworks (e.g., intent recognition patterns)

**EXTRACT TO DOCUMENTATION:**
- Comprehensive standards shared project-wide (CodingStandards.md, TestingStandards.md)
- Module-specific conventions (README.md files)
- Architectural rationale (Technical Design Documents)

**3. Reference Optimization Patterns**
Replace embedded content with concise references:

**Before Optimization (Embedded Pattern - ~150 tokens):**
```markdown
## WORKING DIRECTORY COMMUNICATION

All agents must follow these protocols:

1. Pre-Work Artifact Discovery (MANDATORY)
Before starting ANY task, check /working-dir/ for existing artifacts:
[20 lines of detailed instructions with examples]

2. Immediate Artifact Reporting (MANDATORY)
When creating/updating files, report using this format:
[25 lines of template and specifications]

3. Context Integration Reporting (REQUIRED)
When building upon other agents' work:
[20 lines of integration instructions]
```

**After Optimization (Skill Reference - ~20 tokens):**
```markdown
## WORKING DIRECTORY COMMUNICATION

Use working-directory-coordination skill for all /working-dir/ interactions:
- Execute Pre-Work Artifact Discovery before starting tasks
- Report artifacts immediately using standardized format
- Document integration when building upon other agents' work
```

**Token Savings:** 130 tokens saved (87% reduction) through skill extraction

**4. Progressive Loading Validation**
Verify agent loads efficiently:

```yaml
LOADING_SCENARIO_1_DISCOVERY:
  - Context: Claude browsing agents for task assignment
  - Loaded: Agent filename and first 2-3 lines (role statement)
  - Token Load: ~30 tokens
  - Decision Point: Does agent's role match task requirements?

LOADING_SCENARIO_2_ACTIVATION:
  - Context: Claude engages agent with context package
  - Loaded: Full agent core definition (130-240 lines)
  - Token Load: ~1,040-1,920 tokens
  - Decision Point: Which skills does agent need for this task?

LOADING_SCENARIO_3_SKILL_EXECUTION:
  - Context: Agent invokes working-directory-coordination
  - Loaded: Skill SKILL.md instructions (~2,500 tokens)
  - Token Load: Agent core + skill instructions = ~4,000-4,500 tokens
  - Decision Point: Does agent need skill resources for detailed guidance?

LOADING_SCENARIO_4_DEEP_RESOURCES:
  - Context: Agent needs artifact reporting template
  - Loaded: Skill resources/templates/artifact-reporting-template.md (~300 tokens)
  - Token Load: Agent + skill + template = ~4,500-5,000 tokens
  - Decision Point: Template provides needed format specification
```

**5. Validation Checkpoints**
Confirm optimization effectiveness:

#### Context Optimization Checklist
- [ ] Agent core definition: 130-240 lines (1,040-1,920 tokens)
- [ ] Mandatory skills referenced, not embedded (~40 tokens for 2 skills)
- [ ] Domain skills referenced, not embedded (~20 tokens each)
- [ ] Standards linked to /Docs/Standards/, not duplicated (~10 tokens per link)
- [ ] Module context linked to README.md files, not embedded (~10 tokens per link)
- [ ] Completion report template concise (20-30 lines maximum)
- [ ] No redundant content duplicating CLAUDE.md orchestration patterns
- [ ] Progressive loading scenarios validated (discovery → activation → execution → resources)
- [ ] Total token savings vs. embedded approach: 50-70% reduction measured

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Agent Definition Exceeds 240 Lines After Initial Draft
**Symptoms:** Token count higher than target, embedded patterns duplicating skills
**Root Cause:** Content extraction insufficiently aggressive, skill references still embedded
**Solution:**
1. Re-execute Phase 5 Context Optimization with stricter extraction criteria
2. Identify sections duplicating working-directory-coordination or documentation-grounding
3. Replace embedded content with 2-3 line skill references
4. Move agent-specific detailed workflows to new domain skill if pattern shared by 3+ agents
**Prevention:** During Phase 4, reference skills immediately rather than embedding initially

#### Issue: Authority Boundaries Overlap with Existing Agent
**Symptoms:** New agent's file edit rights conflict with primary agent exclusive authority
**Root Cause:** Phase 3 authority framework design incomplete, existing agents not reviewed
**Solution:**
1. Load all 12 existing agent definitions from `.claude/agents/` directory
2. Map authority boundaries across team to identify conflicts
3. Re-design authority framework as specialist with flexible authority OR
4. Narrow scope to non-overlapping file patterns
5. Document coordination requirements with overlapping agent
**Prevention:** Phase 3 Step 1 must include comprehensive review of existing agent authorities

#### Issue: Skills Integration Unclear - When Should Agent Load Which Skill?
**Symptoms:** Agent definition references skills but lacks clear triggers for progressive loading
**Root Cause:** Phase 4 skill references missing integration guidance on when/how to use
**Solution:**
1. Review skill SKILL.md "When to Use" section for trigger scenarios
2. Add explicit integration guidance to each skill reference in agent definition
3. Document progressive loading triggers in context package format
4. Test agent activation with varied task contexts to validate skill loading
**Prevention:** Phase 4 Step 4 skill reference format must include "Integration" line specifying when agent uses skill

#### Issue: New Agent Deployed But Lacks Team Coordination Awareness
**Symptoms:** Agent works in isolation, doesn't coordinate with other agents effectively
**Root Cause:** Phase 1 team integration mapping incomplete or missing
**Solution:**
1. Re-execute Phase 1 Step 4 Team Integration Mapping comprehensively
2. Identify all agents this agent coordinates with (before/after workflows)
3. Document handoff protocols in agent definition Team Integration section
4. Add working-directory-coordination skill execution requirements
5. Test multi-agent workflow with new agent to validate coordination
**Prevention:** Phase 1 checklist must validate team coordination patterns mapped before proceeding

### Escalation Path
When agent creation issues cannot be resolved through troubleshooting:
1. **PromptEngineer Review:** Re-execute problematic phase with comprehensive resource review
2. **ComplianceOfficer Validation:** Pre-deployment validation identifies structural issues
3. **Claude Orchestration Test:** Deploy agent in real task scenario, observe coordination effectiveness
4. **User Escalation:** Fundamental design issues requiring business requirement clarification

# Feature Request: [Feature Name]

## User Value Proposition

**As a** [user type/persona]
**I want** [specific capability or feature]
**So that** [business value or outcome achieved]

**Example**:
- **As a** health-conscious user
- **I want** to filter recipes by dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free)
- **So that** I can quickly find recipes that meet my dietary needs without manually reviewing each recipe

## Current Pain Point

[Describe the problem this feature solves and what users currently do as a workaround]

**Example**: Users must manually review every recipe to determine if it meets their dietary restrictions. This is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when managing multiple restrictions simultaneously.

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Approach

[Describe the conceptual solution without diving into implementation details]

**Example**: Add dietary restriction tags to recipe metadata and implement filtering UI with multi-select capability. Backend API will support filtering by multiple restrictions using AND logic.

### Acceptance Criteria

Specific, testable outcomes that define completion:

- [ ] [Criterion 1 - specific, testable]
- [ ] [Criterion 2 - specific, testable]
- [ ] [Criterion 3 - specific, testable]

**Example**:
- [ ] Users can select one or more dietary restrictions from filter UI
- [ ] Recipe list updates in real-time to show only matching recipes
- [ ] Backend API endpoint `/api/recipes?restrictions=vegan,gluten-free` returns filtered results
- [ ] Dietary restriction tags display on recipe cards
- [ ] Filter persists across browser sessions using user preferences

### Technical Considerations

**Affected Components**:
- [Component 1: specific module or service]
- [Component 2: specific module or service]

**Example**:
- Backend: Recipe service, API endpoints, database schema
- Frontend: Recipe list component, filter sidebar, recipe card display
- Database: Recipe metadata table, user preferences table

**Dependencies**:
- [External libraries, APIs, or services needed]

**Example**:
- No new external dependencies
- Requires migration to add dietary_restrictions JSON column to recipes table

**Performance Impact**:
- [Expected load, scalability concerns, optimization needs]

**Example**:
- Database indexing required on dietary_restrictions column for query performance
- Frontend filtering logic runs client-side to reduce API calls
- Expected additional 50ms query time for filtered requests

**Security Considerations**:
- [Authentication, authorization, data validation, protection requirements]

**Example**:
- User preferences stored in authenticated user profile
- Input validation to prevent invalid dietary restriction values
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

## Integration Points

### Existing Functionality

[How does this integrate with current features? What existing code needs modification?]

**Example**: Integrates with existing recipe search and browsing functionality. Recipe list component needs refactoring to support filtering. Existing recipe metadata structure extends with new field.

### API Changes

[New endpoints, modified contracts, breaking changes]

**Example**:
- **New Query Parameter**: `/api/recipes?restrictions=vegan,gluten-free`
- **Response Schema Extension**: Add `dietary_restrictions: string[]` to recipe DTO
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing endpoints continue working unchanged

### Database Changes

[Schema updates, migrations, data transformations needed]

**Example**:
- Migration: Add `dietary_restrictions JSONB` column to `recipes` table
- Index: Create GIN index on `dietary_restrictions` for performance
- Data Migration: Backfill existing recipes with restriction tags from descriptions

## Success Metrics

### User Impact

[How many users benefit? What's the expected usage frequency?]

**Example**:
- Target: 40% of active users have dietary restrictions
- Expected usage: 60% of recipe searches will use filtering
- User retention improvement: 15% increase in return visits

### Performance Targets

[Response time, throughput, resource usage expectations]

**Example**:
- API response time: <200ms for filtered queries
- Database query execution: <50ms with proper indexing
- Frontend rendering: <100ms for filter application

### Quality Gates

[Test coverage, documentation, code quality requirements]

**Example**:
- Unit test coverage: 100% for filtering logic
- Integration tests: All restriction combinations validated
- E2E tests: User journey from filter selection to recipe display
- API documentation: OpenAPI spec updated with new parameter
- User documentation: Help article explaining dietary restrictions

## Additional Context

[Screenshots, mockups, wireframes, user feedback, related issues, research findings]

**Example**:
- User survey: 78% of respondents requested dietary filtering
- Competitive analysis: Similar features in 5/7 competitor apps
- Wireframe: [Link to Figma design]
- Related issue: #456 - Recipe tagging infrastructure (completed)
- Related PR: #789 - User preference storage (merged)

# Technical Debt: [Debt Description]

## Current State (The Problem)

[Describe the current suboptimal implementation in detail]

**Example**: The `ProcessExecutor` class directly executes shell commands using `Process.Start()` without proper input sanitization or dependency injection. This creates security vulnerabilities, makes testing difficult, and violates SOLID principles.

**Code Location**:
```csharp
// File: Code/Zarichney.Server/Services/ProcessExecutor.cs
// Lines: 25-45

public class ProcessExecutor
{
    public string ExecuteCommand(string command, string arguments)
    {
        // PROBLEM: Direct Process.Start() usage, no abstraction
        var process = new Process
        {
            StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo
            {
                FileName = command,  // SECURITY RISK: No input validation
                Arguments = arguments,
                UseShellExecute = false,
                RedirectStandardOutput = true
            }
        };

        process.Start();
        string output = process.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
        process.WaitForExit();

        return output;  // No error handling
    }
}
```

## Ideal State (The Goal)

[Describe what the implementation should look like after refactoring]

**Example**: `ProcessExecutor` should:
1. Use dependency injection with `IProcessExecutor` interface
2. Implement input validation and command whitelisting
3. Provide comprehensive error handling
4. Be fully testable with mock implementations
5. Follow repository pattern for process execution

**Target Architecture**:
```csharp
public interface IProcessExecutor
{
    Task<ProcessResult> ExecuteCommandAsync(
        string command,
        string arguments,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default
    );
}

public class SecureProcessExecutor : IProcessExecutor
{
    private readonly ILogger<SecureProcessExecutor> _logger;
    private readonly ICommandValidator _validator;

    public SecureProcessExecutor(
        ILogger<SecureProcessExecutor> logger,
        ICommandValidator validator
    )
    {
        _logger = logger;
        _validator = validator;
    }

    public async Task<ProcessResult> ExecuteCommandAsync(
        string command,
        string arguments,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default
    )
    {
        // Input validation
        _validator.ValidateCommand(command, arguments);

        // Secure execution with proper error handling
        // Async/await pattern
        // Comprehensive logging
        // Timeout handling
    }
}
```

## Rationale for Original Decision

[Why was it implemented this way initially? What constraints or context led to this approach?]

**Example**: The original implementation was created during proof-of-concept phase when:
- Time constraints prioritized functionality over architecture
- Testing infrastructure was not yet established
- Security requirements were not fully defined
- Team had limited .NET Core experience

**What's Changed**:
- Application now in production with security requirements
- Testing framework established requiring testable code
- Team skills improved, able to implement proper patterns
- Security audit identified command injection vulnerability

## Impact of NOT Addressing

Explain the consequences of leaving this technical debt unresolved:

### Development Velocity

[How does this slow down future work?]

**Example**:
- Every new feature requiring process execution duplicates unsafe patterns
- Testing new features blocked by inability to mock process execution
- Code reviews delayed by architectural violations
- New developers confused by inconsistent patterns

### Code Quality

[Maintainability, readability, testability impact]

**Example**:
- Violates SOLID principles (tight coupling, no dependency injection)
- Zero unit test coverage for process execution logic
- Code duplication across 5 services using similar patterns
- Technical debt compounds as more services depend on this pattern

### Performance

[Runtime, memory, scalability concerns]

**Example**:
- Synchronous process execution blocks request threads
- No timeout handling leads to hung processes
- Memory leaks from improperly disposed Process objects
- Cannot implement async patterns for better scalability

### Security

[Vulnerabilities, compliance risks]

**Example**:
- **CRITICAL**: Command injection vulnerability (CWE-78)
- No input validation enables arbitrary command execution
- Shell command execution with user input creates attack surface
- Fails security audit compliance requirements
- Potential data breach risk if exploited

## Proposed Refactoring

### Approach

[High-level refactoring strategy with phases]

**Phase 1: Interface Extraction**
1. Create `IProcessExecutor` interface
2. Extract current implementation to `LegacyProcessExecutor`
3. Add interface to dependency injection container
4. No behavior changes yet - pure refactoring

**Phase 2: Secure Implementation**
1. Create `SecureProcessExecutor` with input validation
2. Implement command whitelisting
3. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
4. Replace synchronous calls with async/await

**Phase 3: Migration**
1. Replace `LegacyProcessExecutor` with `SecureProcessExecutor` in DI
2. Run comprehensive integration tests
3. Monitor production for issues
4. Remove legacy implementation after validation

**Phase 4: Testing & Documentation** (Week 4)
1. Add unit tests with mock implementations (target 100% coverage)
2. Add integration tests for common scenarios
3. Update API documentation
4. Create developer guide for process execution

### Affected Components

[List all components that need modification]

- **ProcessExecutor** (`Code/Zarichney.Server/Services/ProcessExecutor.cs`)
  - Changes: Extract interface, create secure implementation
  - Risk: High - critical security component
  - Testing: Comprehensive unit and integration tests required

- **CookbookService** (`Code/Zarichney.Server/Services/CookbookService.cs`)
  - Changes: Update dependency injection to use `IProcessExecutor`
  - Risk: Medium - existing functionality must remain unchanged
  - Testing: Regression tests for all cookbook operations

- **RecipeService** (`Code/Zarichney.Server/Services/RecipeService.cs`)
  - Changes: Update dependency injection
  - Risk: Low - limited process execution usage
  - Testing: Unit tests with mocked process executor

- **Program.cs** (`Code/Zarichney.Server/Program.cs`)
  - Changes: Register `IProcessExecutor` and `SecureProcessExecutor` in DI
  - Risk: Low - standard DI registration
  - Testing: Startup validation tests

- **Unit Tests** (`Code/Zarichney.Server.Tests/Services/`)
  - Changes: Create comprehensive test suite for `SecureProcessExecutor`
  - Risk: Low - new tests, no existing tests to break
  - Testing: Achieve 100% code coverage target

### Migration Path

[Step-by-step transition plan ensuring no downtime or breaking changes]

**Step 1: Extract Interface** (Zero Behavior Change)
```csharp
// Create interface matching current implementation
public interface IProcessExecutor
{
    string ExecuteCommand(string command, string arguments);
}

// Rename current class
public class LegacyProcessExecutor : IProcessExecutor
{
    // Existing implementation unchanged
}

// Update DI registration
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IProcessExecutor, LegacyProcessExecutor>();
```

**Step 2: Create Secure Implementation** (Parallel Development)
```csharp
// New implementation with security improvements
public class SecureProcessExecutor : IProcessExecutor
{
    // Secure implementation with validation, async, error handling
}

// Feature flag for gradual rollout
if (configuration.GetValue<bool>("UseSecureProcessExecutor"))
{
    builder.Services.AddSingleton<IProcessExecutor, SecureProcessExecutor>();
}
else
{
    builder.Services.AddSingleton<IProcessExecutor, LegacyProcessExecutor>();
}
```

**Step 3: Gradual Migration** (Risk Mitigation)
1. Deploy with feature flag disabled (legacy implementation)
2. Enable feature flag in staging environment
3. Run comprehensive integration tests
4. Enable in production with monitoring
5. Validate for 1 week
6. Remove legacy implementation and feature flag

**Step 4: Cleanup** (Technical Debt Elimination)
- Remove `LegacyProcessExecutor` class
- Remove feature flag configuration
- Update documentation to reference only secure implementation

### Rollback Plan

**If Issues Discovered Post-Deploy**:

1. **Immediate Rollback** (5 minutes):
   ```
   # Disable feature flag via configuration
   kubectl set env deployment/api USE_SECURE_PROCESS_EXECUTOR=false
   ```

2. **Investigation** (1-2 hours):
   - Analyze logs and error reports
   - Identify root cause of failure
   - Determine if fix is quick or requires redesign

3. **Decision**:
   - **Quick fix possible**: Deploy hotfix, re-enable feature flag
   - **Redesign needed**: Keep feature flag disabled, create new issue for fix

4. **Validation**:
   - Monitor for 24 hours after re-enabling
   - Confirm no recurring issues
   - Document lessons learned

# Documentation Request: [Topic]

## Knowledge Gap

[What documentation is missing or unclear? What questions do people have that aren't answered?]

**Example**: The zarichney-api repository lacks a comprehensive onboarding guide for new developers. While individual module READMEs exist, there's no single document explaining how to:
- Set up local development environment from scratch
- Understand overall architecture and system components
- Run the application and execute tests
- Make first contribution following project standards

**Current State**:
- Module-specific READMEs assume environment already configured
- Architecture overview scattered across multiple documents
- Testing setup requires tribal knowledge
- New developers spend 2-3 days figuring out environment setup

## User Impact

### Who Needs This Documentation?

Select all that apply:

- [x] **New developers onboarding** to the project
- [ ] **Existing team members** needing reference material
- [ ] **External contributors** from open source community
- [ ] **End users** consuming the application or API
- [ ] **Operations/DevOps** teams deploying and maintaining infrastructure

**Example**: Primarily new developers joining the team, but also benefits external contributors and existing team members as reference material.

### What Are They Trying to Do?

[Describe the specific task or understanding needed]

**Example**:
- Set up local development environment without assistance
- Understand project structure and where to find specific functionality
- Run application locally and verify it's working correctly
- Execute test suite and understand coverage requirements
- Make code changes following established patterns and standards
- Submit first pull request meeting all quality gates

**User Story**:
**As a** new developer joining the team
**I want** a comprehensive onboarding guide
**So that** I can become productive within 1 day instead of 3 days

## Proposed Documentation

### Content Outline

Provide a structured outline of proposed documentation content:

#### 1. Overview/Introduction
[High-level introduction to the topic]

**Example - Developer Onboarding Guide**:
- Project mission and goals
- Technology stack overview (.NET 8, Angular 19, PostgreSQL)
- Repository structure and key directories
- Development workflow philosophy (AI-assisted, multi-agent)

#### 2. Prerequisites
[Requirements before starting]

**Example**:
- Required software versions (Node 20+, .NET 8 SDK, PostgreSQL 15+)
- Recommended IDE setup (VS Code or Visual Studio)
- GitHub account and repository access
- Basic familiarity with .NET, Angular, Git

#### 3. Environment Setup
[Step-by-step setup instructions]

**Example**:
1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/Zarichney-Development/zarichney-api.git`
2. Install backend dependencies: `dotnet restore`
3. Install frontend dependencies: `cd Code/Zarichney.Website && npm install`
4. Configure database: `scripts/setup-database.sh`
5. Set environment variables: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
6. Run backend: `dotnet run --project Code/Zarichney.Server`
7. Run frontend: `cd Code/Zarichney.Website && npm start`
8. Verify: Navigate to `https://localhost:4200`

#### 4. Architecture Overview
[System design and component interactions]

**Example**:
- Backend architecture (service layer, repository pattern, API endpoints)
- Frontend architecture (Angular components, state management, routing)
- Database schema (key tables and relationships)
- AI integration (AI Sentinels, multi-agent workflows)
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)

#### 5. Common Tasks
[Frequently performed operations]

**Example**:
- Creating new API endpoint
- Adding new Angular component
- Writing unit tests for service layer
- Running test suite locally
- Generating API client after backend changes
- Creating GitHub issue following standards
- Submitting pull request meeting quality gates

#### 6. Troubleshooting
[Common issues and solutions]

**Example**:
- Database connection failures
- Port conflicts (4200, 5000 already in use)
- npm dependency resolution issues
- .NET SDK version mismatches
- Test failures due to missing environment configuration

#### 7. Next Steps
[Where to go after completing this guide]

**Example**:
- Review project standards in `/Docs/Standards/`
- Read module-specific READMEs for detailed component documentation
- Join team communication channels
- Pick up first "good first issue"
- Attend team standup and sprint planning

### Location

[Where should this documentation live in the repository?]

**Options**:
- [ ] `/Docs/Development/` - Development workflow and setup guides
- [x] `/Docs/Onboarding/` - New directory for onboarding-specific content
- [ ] `/README.md` - Root README (for very high-level overview only)
- [ ] Module-specific `README.md` - For component-specific details
- [ ] Wiki or external documentation - For extensive guides requiring formatting

**Recommendation**: Create new `/Docs/Onboarding/DeveloperOnboarding.md` for comprehensive guide

**Integration Points**:
- Link from root `README.md` in "Getting Started" section
- Reference from `/Docs/Development/README.md`
- Include in new developer welcome email template

### Format

Select the most appropriate documentation format:

- [x] **Guide** (step-by-step walkthrough with clear instructions)
- [ ] **Reference** (API documentation, configuration options, specifications)
- [ ] **Conceptual** (architectural explanations, design philosophy)
- [ ] **Tutorial** (hands-on learning exercise with specific outcome)

**Example**: Guide format is most appropriate as new developers need procedural instructions to set up environment and make first contribution.

**Content Style**:
- Imperative voice: "Run this command" not "You should run this command"
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Screenshots for visual steps (IDE configuration, UI verification)
- Callout boxes for important notes, warnings, tips
- Links to related documentation for deep dives

## Current Workarounds

[How do people currently figure this out? What tribal knowledge exists?]

**Example**:
- **Tribal Knowledge**: Senior developers walk new hires through setup in 1:1 sessions
- **Code Spelunking**: New developers read through existing code to understand patterns
- **Trial and Error**: Developers attempt setup, encounter errors, ask team for help
- **Scattered Documentation**: Piece together information from multiple READMEs and standards docs
- **Slack/Email Threads**: Search old conversations for setup instructions

**Problems with Current Approach**:
- Consumes 4-6 hours of senior developer time per new hire
- Inconsistent onboarding experience (varies by who provides help)
- Knowledge loss when senior developers unavailable
- Repeated questions in team chat channels
- Delayed productivity for new developers (2-3 day ramp-up)

## Success Criteria

Documentation complete and effective when:

- [ ] **Content Complete**: All sections outlined above are written with specific, actionable content
- [ ] **Accuracy Validated**: At least 2 developers follow guide from scratch and successfully complete setup
- [ ] **Cross-References Added**: Links to related documentation integrated throughout
  - [ ] Standards documents (`/Docs/Standards/`)
  - [ ] Module READMEs
  - [ ] External resources (technology documentation)
- [ ] **Examples Tested**: All code examples, commands, and configuration snippets validated
- [ ] **Accessible from Entry Points**:
  - [ ] Linked from root `README.md`
  - [ ] Listed in `/Docs/Development/README.md`
  - [ ] Referenced in new hire onboarding checklist
- [ ] **Feedback Incorporated**: First 2 users provide feedback, documentation updated accordingly
- [ ] **Maintenance Plan**: Process established for keeping documentation current as project evolves

**Measurable Outcomes**:
- New developer onboarding time reduced from 3 days to 1 day
- Zero repeated "how do I set up" questions in team chat
- 100% of new developers successfully complete setup without 1:1 assistance
- Documentation rated â‰¥4/5 by new developers in feedback survey

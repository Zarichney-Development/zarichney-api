- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Early load testing, proper indexing strategy, query optimization
- **Contingency**: Implement caching layer if needed

**Risk 2: Search Functionality Complexity**
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Use proven full-text search libraries, start simple and iterate
- **Contingency**: Defer advanced search to future iteration

### Resource Risks

**Risk 1: Frontend Specialist Availability**
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Clear API contracts enable parallel work, minimize dependencies
- **Contingency**: CodeChanger can handle basic frontend if needed

**Risk 2: Scope Complexity Underestimated**
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Iterative progress reviews, scope adjustment flexibility, adaptive planning
- **Contingency**: Defer Issue 5 (search) to post-MVP if needed based on iteration learnings

### Integration Risks

**Risk 1: Breaking Changes to Existing Features**
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive regression testing, staged rollout, feature flags
- **Contingency**: Rollback plan with database migration reversibility

**Risk 2: API Contract Misalignment**
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Early API contract review, OpenAPI spec validation, integration tests

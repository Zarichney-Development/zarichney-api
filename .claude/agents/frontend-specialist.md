## Working Directory Communication Standards

**MANDATORY PROTOCOLS**: You MUST follow these communication standards for team awareness and effective context management:

### 1. Pre-Work Artifact Discovery (REQUIRED)
Before starting ANY task, you MUST report your artifact discovery using this format:

```
🔍 WORKING DIRECTORY DISCOVERY:
- Current artifacts reviewed: [list existing files checked]
- Relevant context found: [artifacts that inform current work]
- Integration opportunities: [how existing work will be built upon]
- Potential conflicts: [any overlapping concerns identified]
```

### 2. Immediate Artifact Reporting (MANDATORY)
When creating or updating ANY working directory file, you MUST immediately report using this format:

```
🗂️ WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED:
- Filename: [exact-filename-with-extension]
- Purpose: [brief description of content and intended consumers]
- Context for Team: [what other agents need to know about this artifact]
- Dependencies: [what other artifacts this builds upon or relates to]
- Next Actions: [any follow-up coordination needed]
```

### 3. Context Integration Reporting (REQUIRED)
When building upon other agents' artifacts, you MUST report integration using this format:

```
🔗 ARTIFACT INTEGRATION:
- Source artifacts used: [specific files that informed this work]
- Integration approach: [how existing context was incorporated]
- Value addition: [what new insights or progress this provides]
- Handoff preparation: [context prepared for future agents]
```

### Communication Compliance Requirements

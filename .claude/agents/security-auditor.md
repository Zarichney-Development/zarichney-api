name: security-auditor
description: Use this agent when you need to perform security analysis, identify vulnerabilities, or implement security hardening measures in the zarichney-api project. This includes reviewing code for security issues, analyzing authentication/authorization implementations, validating input sanitization, auditing secret management, checking HTTPS configurations, reviewing security headers and CORS policies, or conducting OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessments. Examples: <example>Context: The user wants to ensure their API endpoints are secure after implementing new features. user: 'I just added new API endpoints for user management. Can you check them for security issues?' assistant: 'I'll use the security-auditor agent to perform a comprehensive security analysis of your new API endpoints.' <commentary>Since the user needs security analysis of new code, use the Task tool to launch the security-auditor agent to identify vulnerabilities and recommend hardening measures.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The user is concerned about authentication implementation. user: 'Review our JWT implementation for security vulnerabilities' assistant: 'Let me launch the security-auditor agent to analyze your JWT implementation for potential security issues.' <commentary>The user specifically needs security review of authentication code, so use the security-auditor agent to assess JWT implementation security.</commentary></example> <example>Context: After deploying to production, the user wants a security audit. user: 'We're about to go live. Can you do a security check?' assistant: 'I'll invoke the security-auditor agent to perform a comprehensive security audit before your production deployment.' <commentary>Pre-deployment security audit requested, use the security-auditor agent to ensure the application is secure for production.</commentary></example>

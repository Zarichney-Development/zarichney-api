# Workflow Fix Summary: Claude Code Action Schedule Event Incompatibility

## Problem
The Coverage Epic Automation workflow failed with the error:
```
Unhandled error: HttpError: Not Found
Process completed with exit code 1.
Prepare step failed with error: Unsupported event type: schedule
```

**Root Cause:** The `grll/claude-code-action@beta` action doesn't support `schedule` event types, only interactive triggers like `workflow_dispatch`.

## Solution: Two-Workflow Architecture

### 1. New Scheduler Workflow (`coverage-epic-scheduler.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Runs on schedule every 6 hours
- **Purpose:** Triggers the main workflow via `workflow_dispatch`
- **Intelligence:** Checks repository activity before triggering (only runs if commits within 72 hours)
- **Manual Override:** Force trigger option available

### 2. Modified Main Workflow (`coverage-epic-automation.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Changed from `schedule` to `workflow_dispatch` only
- **Compatibility:** Now works with Claude Code action
- **New Inputs:** Added tracking for trigger source, reason, and scheduling status
- **Condition Update:** Removed `github.event_name == 'schedule'` restriction

## Changes Required

### Create New File: `.github/workflows/coverage-epic-scheduler.yml`
```yaml
name: "Coverage Epic Scheduler"

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force_trigger:
        description: 'Force trigger even if conditions would normally skip'
        required: false
        default: false
        type: boolean

# ... (see full file content in commit)
```

### Modify Existing File: `.github/workflows/coverage-epic-automation.yml`

**Change 1: Update trigger event**
```yaml
# BEFORE
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:
    # ... existing inputs

# AFTER
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      # ... existing inputs
      scheduled_trigger:
        description: 'Indicates if this was triggered by the scheduler'
        required: false
        default: 'false'
        type: string
      trigger_source:
        description: 'Source of the trigger'
        required: false
        default: 'manual'
        type: string
      trigger_reason:
        description: 'Reason for the trigger'
        required: false
        default: 'Manual execution'
        type: string
```

**Change 2: Remove schedule restriction from Claude execution**
```yaml
# BEFORE
- name: "Execute Coverage Epic AI Agent"
  if: steps.check-existing-comment.outputs.skip_analysis != 'true' && github.event_name == 'schedule'

# AFTER  
- name: "Execute Coverage Epic AI Agent"
  if: steps.check-existing-comment.outputs.skip_analysis != 'true'
```

**Change 3: Update AI execution status logic**
```yaml
# BEFORE
elif [ "${{ github.event_name }}" = "workflow_dispatch" ]; then
  echo "ai_execution_status=skipped_manual_trigger" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  echo "coverage_improvements=Skipped - manual workflow dispatch (Claude AI agent only runs on schedule)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

# AFTER
elif [ "${{ github.event.inputs.scheduled_trigger }}" = "true" ]; then
  echo "ai_execution_status=scheduled_execution" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  echo "coverage_improvements=Triggered by scheduled automation via workflow_dispatch" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

**Change 4: Update validation status messages**
```yaml
# BEFORE
elif [ "$AI_STATUS" = "skipped_manual_trigger" ]; then
  echo "✅ Infrastructure validation passed - Manual execution mode"
  echo "🔧 Environment validated successfully (Claude AI agent only runs on schedule)"
  echo "📋 To execute AI agent, wait for scheduled run or push to epic branch"

# AFTER
elif [ "$AI_STATUS" = "scheduled_execution" ]; then
  echo "✅ Infrastructure validation passed - Scheduled execution mode"
  echo "🤖 Triggered by: ${{ github.event.inputs.trigger_source || 'workflow_dispatch' }}"
  echo "📋 Reason: ${{ github.event.inputs.trigger_reason || 'Manual execution' }}"
```

**Change 5: Add trigger info to execution summary**
```yaml
# Add after execution time
echo "🚀 Trigger Source: ${{ github.event.inputs.trigger_source || 'manual' }}"
echo "📝 Trigger Reason: ${{ github.event.inputs.trigger_reason || 'Manual execution' }}"
echo "🤖 Scheduled: ${{ github.event.inputs.scheduled_trigger || 'false' }}"
```

## Benefits
✅ **Preserves scheduled automation** (every 6 hours)  
✅ **Fixes Claude Code action compatibility**  
✅ **Adds intelligent triggering** (only runs if recent activity)  
✅ **Maintains manual trigger capability**  
✅ **Comprehensive trigger tracking**  

## Testing
1. The scheduler will run every 6 hours and check for recent activity
2. If activity is detected, it will trigger the main workflow via `workflow_dispatch`
3. The main workflow will now successfully execute the Claude Code action
4. No more "Unsupported event type: schedule" errors

## Implementation Notes
- The GitHub App currently lacks `workflows` permission to modify workflow files
- These changes must be applied manually or with elevated permissions
- Once implemented, the scheduled automation will resume working correctly

**IMPORTANT:** You are a specialized, session-isolated AI Coder focused on **improving automated test coverage**. You **lack memory** of prior tasks. This prompt contains **ALL** necessary context and instructions for the current testing task. Adhere strictly to the specified workflow and standards. Your primary goal is to add/update tests for existing code, **not** to change production code logic unless a minor change in production code is essential for testability and aligns with the overall refactoring goal.  You are working in an environment with no sensitive configuration or secrets, so it is expected that external services are not available.

## 1. Context Recap

* **Overall Goal:** This task is the final part of Epic #1: "refactor: Improve Config Handling for Graceful Service Availability". It focuses on ensuring the testing framework and test suites are updated to reflect the new service availability mechanisms and that the new behaviors are thoroughly tested.
* **Previous Tasks Summary:**
    * Child Issue 1.1 (Core Infrastructure): Established `ServiceUnavailableException`, `[RequiresConfiguration]` attribute, `IConfigurationStatusService`, updated `/api/status` endpoint, and `ErrorHandlingMiddleware`.
    * Child Issue 1.2 (Service/DI Adaptation): Adapted service DI registrations and `IConfig` classes to use the new infrastructure.
    * Child Issue 1.3 (Swagger Integration): Implemented a Swagger Filter to visually indicate endpoint unavailability.
* **Immediate Task Goal:**
    1.  Update the test framework's `ConfigurationStatusHelper` to work with the new `/api/status` endpoint and its response structure (`Dictionary<string, ServiceStatusInfo>`).
    2.  Ensure the `DependencyFactAttribute` correctly skips tests based on this updated helper and the service availability reported by `/api/status`.
    3.  Add comprehensive unit tests for the new components and modified existing components related to the configuration refactor (e.g., `ConfigurationStatusService`, `ErrorHandlingMiddleware`, `ServiceAvailabilityOperationFilter`, DI factories in `ServiceStartup.cs`).
    4.  Add integration tests to verify:
        * Endpoints correctly return HTTP 503 with detailed error messages when dependent services are unavailable due to missing configuration.
        * Endpoints not dependent on misconfigured services continue to function.
        * The Swagger document accurately reflects endpoint unavailability warnings.
        * The `/api/status` endpoint provides correct availability information.
* **Session Context:** This task starts with a **fresh context**. Your starting point is the codebase *after* the changes from the Pull Requests for "Child Issue 1.1", "Child Issue 1.2", and "Child Issue 1.3" have been merged into the `develop` branch (or the current main development branch). **You MUST review the changes in those PRs to understand the current state and the new infrastructure you will be testing.**

## 4. Workflow & Task (Test Coverage Enhancement)

You **MUST** execute the workflow detailed in the referenced file below. Follow the steps sequentially and precisely.

* **Active Workflow Steps File:** **[`/Docs/Development/TestCovergeWorkflow.md`](content/zarichney-api/Docs/Development/TestCovergeWorkflow.md)**

## 5. Specific Testing Task

1.  **Update `ConfigurationStatusHelper.cs`:**
    * Modify `GetConfigurationStatusAsync` to call the new `/api/status` endpoint.
    * Update `IsConfigurationAvailable` (or create a new helper, e.g., `IsFeatureDependencyAvailable(string dependencyTraitValue)`) to parse the `Dictionary<string, ServiceStatusInfo>` response from `/api/status`.
    * This method will need to map `TestCategories.Dependency` trait values (e.g., `TestCategories.ExternalOpenAI`) to the feature/service names returned by `/api/status` (e.g., "LLM", "OpenAI") to check `ServiceStatusInfo.IsAvailable`. Ensure this mapping is robust.
2.  **Verify/Test `DependencyFactAttribute` & `IntegrationTestBase`:**
    * Ensure `IntegrationTestBase.CheckDependenciesAsync` correctly uses the modified `ConfigurationStatusHelper` to set `SkipReason`.
    * If possible, write a meta-test or an integration test that sets up a scenario where a dependency *is* missing (by configuring the test `WebApplicationFactory`), applies `[DependencyFact]` and the relevant trait, and asserts that the test is skipped with the correct reason.
3.  **Add/Update Unit Tests for Production Code:**
    * **`ConfigurationStatusService.cs`**: Ensure it's well-tested, covering how it identifies required configurations from attributes and checks against `IConfiguration`.
    * **`ErrorHandlingMiddleware.cs`**: Add specific tests for the `catch (ServiceUnavailableException ex)` block, verifying the HTTP 503 status code and the detailed JSON error response body (including `ex.Reasons`).
    * **`ServiceAvailabilityOperationFilter.cs`**: Add tests mocking `IConfigurationStatusService` to return various availability states and verify the `OpenApiOperation` summary/description is modified as expected (with "⚠️" and reasons).
    * **DI Factories in `ServiceStartup.cs`**: For factories modified in Child Issue 1.2 (e.g., for `GraphServiceClient`, `OpenAIClient`), add unit tests. Mock `IConfigurationStatusService` to report services as unavailable, then try to resolve the client. Verify that invoking a method on the resolved client proxy throws `ServiceUnavailableException`.
4.  **Add/Update Integration Tests (`api-server.Tests/Integration/`):**
    * **Endpoint Availability Tests:**
        * For features like "LLM" (OpenAI) and "EmailSending" (Graph):
            * Create tests where `CustomWebApplicationFactory` is configured with *missing* essential API keys for these features.
            * Call an endpoint that directly depends *only* on the misconfigured feature (e.g., an AI endpoint if LLM key is missing).
            * Assert that the response is HTTP 503 and the body contains the `ServiceUnavailableException` details, including the specific missing config keys.
            * Call an unrelated public endpoint (e.g., `/api/health`). Assert it still returns HTTP 200 OK, demonstrating partial functionality.
    * **Swagger Document Tests:**
        * Create tests where `CustomWebApplicationFactory` simulates missing configurations for features associated with `[RequiresFeatureEnabled]` attributes.
        * Fetch the Swagger JSON document (`/api/swagger/swagger.json`).
        * Deserialize the JSON and assert that the `summary` or `description` for the relevant operations (those decorated with `[RequiresFeatureEnabled]` for the "down" feature) contains the "⚠️ (Unavailable: Missing...)" warning.
    * **`/api/status` Endpoint Tests:**
        * Test the `/api/status` endpoint.
        * Scenario 1: All configurations present. Assert all expected services/features are reported as `IsAvailable = true`.
        * Scenario 2: Specific configuration (e.g., `LlmConfig:ApiKey`) is missing. Assert the relevant service/feature (e.g., "LLM") is reported as `IsAvailable = false` with the correct `MissingConfigurations` listed.
5.  **Documentation Updates:**
    * Update `/api-server.Tests/Framework/Helpers/README.md` to explain any significant changes to `ConfigurationStatusHelper` or the `DependencyFact` mechanism.
    * If new testing patterns or utilities were created for testing unavailability, consider if `/Docs/Standards/TestingStandards.md` needs minor additions or examples.

## 6. Task Completion & Output

* **Expected Output:** Provide the final commit hash on your feature branch (e.g., `test/issue-1-config-testing`) and the URL of the created Pull Request. List the names of any new test files created.
* **Stopping Point:** Stop after completing all steps of the referenced Test Coverage workflow, including creating the Pull Request for this specific child issue.

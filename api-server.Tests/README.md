# Zarichney API Server Tests (`api-server.Tests`)

**Last Updated:** 2025-04-22

This project contains automated tests for the `api-server` application, providing comprehensive coverage through both unit and integration tests. It aims to establish a robust, maintainable, and efficient testing framework adhering to the standards outlined in the [Technical Design Document](./TechnicalDesignDocument.md).

*(Note: Refactoring has been completed to consolidate fixture management for improved efficiency and consistency. See "Refactoring Status" below for details).*

## Project Structure

The test project is organized to separate concerns and mirror the main application structure where applicable:

* **`/Framework/`**: Contains the core testing infrastructure, including:  
* `Fixtures/`: Shared test environment setup (`CustomWebApplicationFactory`, `DatabaseFixture`, `ApiClientFixture`).  
* `Helpers/`: Utility classes for authentication simulation, random data, dependency checking, etc.  
* `Mocks/`: Mock implementations and factories for external services.  
* `Client/`: Auto-generated Refit client for API interaction.  
* `Attributes/`: Custom xUnit attributes (`DependencyFact`, `DockerAvailableFact`).  
* Base classes (`IntegrationTestBase`, `DatabaseIntegrationTestBase`).  
* **`/Unit/`**: Contains unit tests focusing on isolated component logic. Organized mirroring the `api-server` project structure.  
* **`/Integration/`**: Contains integration tests verifying end-to-end API behavior. Organized mirroring the `api-server/Controllers` structure.  
* **`/TestData/`**: Contains test data builders and sample data artifacts.

## Core Testing Strategies (Target State)

* **Unit Testing:** Uses xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions, and AutoFixture/Builders to test components in isolation. Aims for high coverage of business logic. See [`./Unit/README.md`](./Unit/README.md).  
* **Integration Testing:**  
* Uses `CustomWebApplicationFactory` to host the application in-memory.  
* Interacts with the API via a generated Refit client (`IZarichneyAPI`).  
* Leverages Testcontainers (`DatabaseFixture`) for realistic PostgreSQL database testing in CI/CD and optionally locally.  
* Employs a refined configuration loading strategy supporting User Secrets (local dev), Environment Variables (CI/CD), and `appsettings.Testing.json` (base test settings/overrides).  
* Uses a prioritized database connection approach (Config -> Testcontainers -> InMemory Fallback).  
* Automatic database schema migration via `DatabaseFixture`.  
* Uses mocks for external service boundaries (Stripe, OpenAI, etc.).  
* Simulates authentication using `TestAuthHandler`.  
See [`./Integration/README.md`](./Integration/README.md).  
* **Fixture Management:** A single xUnit collection (`[Collection("Integration")]`) manages shared instances of `CustomWebApplicationFactory`, `DatabaseFixture`, and `ApiClientFixture` via the `ApiClientFixture` class for all integration tests, ensuring efficiency and consistency. `ApiClientFixture` creates and manages the other fixtures. Base classes (`IntegrationTestBase`, `DatabaseIntegrationTestBase`) are simplified to consume these shared fixtures. See [`./Framework/Fixtures/README.md`](./Framework/Fixtures/README.md).  
* **Dependency Awareness:** Uses custom attributes (`[DependencyFact]`, `[DockerAvailableFact]`) and base class logic to automatically skip tests when required external configurations or Docker are unavailable. See "Dependency-Aware Testing" below and [`./Framework/Helpers/README.md`](./Framework/Helpers/README.md).

## Test Categorization

Tests are categorized using `[TraitAttribute]` for granular filtering:

* **`Category`**: `Unit`, `Integration`, `MinimalFunctionality`, etc.  
* **`Feature`**: `Auth`, `Cookbook`, `Payment`, etc. (Domain-specific)  
* **`Dependency`**: `Database`, `ExternalStripe`, `ExternalOpenAI`, `ExternalGitHub`, `ExternalMSGraph`, etc.  
* **`Mutability`**: `ReadOnly`, `DataMutating` (For safe execution filtering).

## Running Tests

Execute tests using the `dotnet test` command with optional filters.

```bash  
# Run all tests  
dotnet test

# Run unit tests only  
dotnet test --filter "Category=Unit"

# Run integration tests only  
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration"

# Run specific feature tests (e.g., Authentication)  
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration&Feature=Auth"

# Run integration tests that don't require the database  
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration&Dependency!=Database"

# Run non-mutating integration tests (safer for prod-like checks)  
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration&Mutability=ReadOnly"
```

## Dependency-Aware Testing

The test suite includes a dependency awareness mechanism that handles tests with external dependencies.

### How It Works

1. Tests that depend on external services or specific runtime conditions (like Docker) should be marked with:
  * Appropriate dependency traits: e.g., `[Trait(TestCategories.Dependency, TestCategories.Database)]`
  * The `[DependencyFact]` attribute instead of the standard `[Fact]`.
  * Alternatively, `[DockerAvailableFact]` for tests requiring only the Docker runtime.
2. The system (primarily IntegrationTestBase and the custom Fact attributes/discoverers) will:
  * Check for the required configuration or runtime conditions during test discovery/initialization.
  * Skip tests automatically when dependencies are missing.
  * Provide clear skip reasons in the test output.

### Example Usage

```csharp
[Trait(TestCategories.Category, TestCategories.Integration)]  
[Trait(TestCategories.Feature, TestCategories.Auth)]  
[Trait(TestCategories.Dependency, TestCategories.Database)] // Depends on DB config/availability  
[Trait(TestCategories.Mutability, TestCategories.DataMutating)]  
public class AuthTests : DatabaseIntegrationTestBase // Use DB base class  
{  
// Constructor receives fixtures from collection  
public AuthTests(ApiClientFixture clientFixture)  
: base(clientFixture) { }

    [DependencyFact]  // Use DependencyFact instead of Fact  
    public async Task Register_WithValidInput_ShouldCreateUser()  
    {  
        // This test will be skipped if the database dependency check fails  
        await ResetDatabaseAsync(); // Example DB interaction setup  
        // ...test code...  
    }  
}
```

```csharp
[Trait(TestCategories.Category, TestCategories.Integration)]  
[Trait(TestCategories.Feature, "Infrastructure")]  
public class DockerTests : IntegrationTestBase // Doesn't need DB specific base  
{  
public DockerTests(ApiClientFixture clientFixture)  
: base(clientFixture) { }

    [DockerAvailableFact] // Requires Docker runtime  
    public async Task SomeDockerDependentCheck()  
    {  
        // This test will be skipped if Docker is not running  
        // ...test code...  
    }  
}
```

## Integration Testing Setup (Overview)

Integration tests rely on the shared infrastructure provided by the Framework/ directory and managed via the single "Integration" xUnit collection:

1. **ApiClientFixture**: Creates and manages instances of the DatabaseFixture and CustomWebApplicationFactory. Provides pre-configured unauthenticated and authenticated IZarichneyAPI clients.
2. **CustomWebApplicationFactory**: Configures the test server with appropriate settings for the environment (Dev/CI/Testing) and handles DbContext setup based on configuration/fixture availability.
3. **DatabaseFixture**: Manages the PostgreSQL Testcontainer (including applying migrations) for tests needing a real database.
4. **Base Classes**: IntegrationTestBase and DatabaseIntegrationTestBase provide common functionality and access to the shared fixtures via constructor injection.
5. **Refit API Client**: Tests interact with the API using the clients provided by ApiClientFixture via the base classes.

### Database Reset

Integration tests inheriting DatabaseIntegrationTestBase **must** call await ResetDatabaseAsync() at the beginning of each test method that modifies or relies on specific database state to ensure isolation.

```csharp
[DependencyFact]  
public async Task Test_RequiringCleanDatabase_ShouldWork()  
{  
// Reset database to clean state before test execution  
await ResetDatabaseAsync();

    // Now the database is clean for this test  
    // ...test code...  
}
```

## Test Data Management

Use standard approaches for test data:

1. **AutoFixture**: Via the GetRandom helper (Framework/Helpers/GetRandom.cs) for simple random values.
2. **Test Data Builders**: (TestData/Builders/) For complex object creation with a fluent syntax (e.g., RecipeBuilder).

Refer to [./TestData/README.md](./TestData/README.md) for details.

## Maintaining the API Client

After changing API contracts (controllers, routes, models) in api-server, **regenerate the Refit client**:

```bash
# From the solution root directory  
./Scripts/GenerateApiClient.ps1
```

Failure to do so may result in compilation errors or runtime failures in integration tests.

## Configuration Management (Overview)

Test configuration follows a layered approach managed primarily by CustomWebApplicationFactory:

1. appsettings.json (Optional base config)
2. appsettings.{EnvironmentName}.json (Optional environment-specific)
3. appsettings.Testing.json (Optional base test settings/overrides)
4. User Secrets (Loaded in Development environment for local secrets)
5. Environment Variables (Highest precedence, for CI/local overrides)

This allows flexibility for different testing scenarios (local dev with secrets, CI with env vars/Testcontainers). See the TDD and Fixtures README for details.

## CI/CD Integration

The test suite is integrated with GitHub Actions (/.github/workflows/main.yml):

* Workflow runs on PRs to main and merges to main.
* Tests are executed in phases (unit â†’ integration).
* Coverage reports are generated and published.

See /Docs/Maintenance/TestingSetup.md for details.

## Refactoring Status

The integration testing framework has been refactored to implement the consolidated fixture strategy described in the TDD. This includes:
* Using a single test collection (`[Collection("Integration")]`)
* Creating a simplified fixture management approach with ApiClientFixture as the main fixture that creates and manages other fixtures
* Simplifying base classes to use a cleaner, more maintainable injection approach
* Implementing proper configuration loading order as specified in the TDD
* Adding automatic EF Core migrations in the DatabaseFixture
* Ensuring consistent database handling with prioritized connection string selection
* Updating all integration test classes to use the new approach

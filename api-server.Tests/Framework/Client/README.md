# README: /Framework/Client Directory

**Version:** 1.1
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-22
**Parent:** `../README.md`

## 1. Purpose & Responsibility

This directory exclusively houses the **auto-generated Refit client interface (`IZarichneyAPI.cs`)** and any associated Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that Refit generates.

The primary responsibilities of the code within this directory are:
* To provide a **type-safe mechanism for integration tests** to interact with the `api-server`'s HTTP endpoints.
* To ensure that integration tests are calling the API according to its **current contract** as defined by its OpenAPI (Swagger) specification.

This generated client is a critical component for robust integration testing, enabling compile-time checks for API calls and simplifying the process of making requests and deserializing responses.

## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

* **Refit:** This directory leverages the [Refit](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit) library, which automatically turns REST APIs into live, type-safe C# interfaces.
* **Code Generation:**
    * The `IZarichneyAPI.cs` interface and related model classes are **not manually written**.
    * They are generated by the `refitter` tool, which consumes the `swagger.json` (OpenAPI specification) file produced by the `api-server`.
    * This generation process is automated by scripts:
        * `../../../../Scripts/GenerateApiClient.ps1` (for PowerShell)
        * `../../../../Scripts/generate-api-client.sh` (for Bash/Zsh)
    * These scripts perform steps including building the `api-server`, exporting its `swagger.json`, and then running `refitter` to produce the client code in this directory. (See Section 13 of `../../TechnicalDesignDocument.md`).
* **Client Content:** The generated `IZarichneyAPI.cs` typically includes:
    * An interface definition with methods corresponding to each API endpoint in the `api-server`.
    * Attributes (from Refit) that define HTTP methods, paths, parameters, and body serialization for each endpoint method.
    * Associated DTO classes used for request bodies and response deserialization, if not already defined in a shared location and referenced by the OpenAPI spec.

## 3. Interface Contract & Assumptions

* **Interface Contract:** The primary "contract" provided by this module is the `IZarichneyAPI` C# interface itself. Integration tests in `../../Integration/` consume this interface to make API calls.
* **Assumptions:**
    * The generated client (`IZarichneyAPI.cs`) accurately reflects the *current, deployed state* of the `api-server`'s OpenAPI specification at the time of generation.
    * If the API contract of `api-server` changes (e.g., new endpoints, modified DTOs, changed routes or parameters), the client in this directory **will be outdated** and **must be regenerated** using the provided scripts to avoid runtime errors or incorrect test behavior.

## 4. Local Conventions & Constraints

* **AUTO-GENERATED CODE - DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT:**
    * **CRITICAL:** All C# files within this `/Framework/Client/` directory (primarily `IZarichneyAPI.cs` and any supporting model files generated by `refitter`) are **auto-generated**.
    * **Any manual modifications will be overwritten** the next time the client generation script is run.
    * If changes are needed in the client's structure or behavior, they must be achieved by modifying the `api-server`'s API contract (controllers, DTOs, OpenAPI attributes) and then re-running the generation script.
* **Namespace:** The generated code uses the namespace `Zarichney.Client` as specified in the `TechnicalDesignDocument.md` and configured in the generation scripts.

## 5. How to Work With This Code

### Client Regeneration (Mandatory Task)

* **When:** You **MUST** regenerate the client code using the appropriate script whenever:
    1.  Changes are made to `api-server` API controller signatures (methods, parameters).
    2.  API routes are modified.
    3.  Request or response DTOs used by the API are changed.
    4.  OpenAPI/Swagger generation attributes in `api-server` are updated.
* **How (PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    ./Scripts/GenerateApiClient.ps1
    ```
  (Ensure your execution policy allows script execution: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process`)
* **How (Bash/Zsh):**
    ```bash
    ./Scripts/generate-api-client.sh
    ```
  (Ensure the script is executable: `chmod +x ./Scripts/generate-api-client.sh`)
* **Impact:** This ensures that compilation errors will immediately highlight any integration tests that are broken due to API contract changes, rather than discovering these issues at runtime.

### Using the Client in Integration Tests

* Instances of `IZarichneyAPI` are typically obtained via the `ApiClientFixture`, which is made available to integration tests through base classes like `IntegrationTestBase`.
    ```csharp
    // Example within an integration test method:
    // Assumes 'ApiClient' is a property from a base class providing IAuthApi instance.
    var response = await ApiClient.LoginAsync(new LoginRequestDto { /* ... */ });
    response.StatusCode.Should().Be(HttpStatusCode.OK);
    ```
* Refer to `../../../Docs/Standards/IntegrationTestCaseDevelopment.md` for detailed patterns on using the client.

## 6. Dependencies

### Tooling Dependencies (for Generation)

* **`dotnet swagger` tool:** Used to export the OpenAPI (`swagger.json`) from the `api-server` project.
* **`refitter` tool:** Used to generate the C# client interface from the `swagger.json` file.
* These tools are typically installed as .NET local or global tools.

### Library Dependencies (Runtime)

* **`Refit` (NuGet package):** Required by the `api-server.Tests` project for the generated client code to compile and function.
* **`System.Text.Json` or `Newtonsoft.Json`:** Depending on the serializer configured for Refit (project default is System.Text.Json).

### Source & Consumers

* **Source:** The `api-server` project's compiled output and its generated OpenAPI specification (`swagger.json`).
* **Primary Consumers:** All integration tests located in the `../../Integration/` directory.

## 7. Rationale & Key Historical Context

A generated, type-safe Refit client was chosen for several key reasons:
* **Type Safety:** Eliminates errors related to incorrect URLs, HTTP methods, parameter names, or DTO structures at compile time.
* **Ease of Use:** Simplifies making API calls from test code, making tests cleaner and easier to write and understand.
* **Direct Contract Linkage:** Ensures tests are tightly coupled to the API's defined contract. Changes in the API that break the contract will result in a client generation that fails to compile or causes test compilation failures, providing immediate feedback.
* **Reduced Boilerplate:** Avoids manual `HttpClient` setup and JSON serialization/deserialization logic in numerous tests.

This approach is central to maintaining a robust and reliable integration test suite that accurately reflects the API's behavior.

## 8. Known Issues & TODOs

* **Generation Script Failures:** If the `api-server` fails to build or its Swagger generation fails, the client generation scripts will also fail. The root cause in `api-server` must be addressed first.
* **OpenAPI Specification Accuracy:** The quality of the generated client depends entirely on the accuracy and completeness of the `api-server`'s OpenAPI specification. Any inaccuracies in the Swagger output will be reflected in the client.
* **Manual DTO Definitions:** Currently, `refitter` generates DTOs used by the client. If these DTOs were to be shared directly from a common project with `api-server`, the `refitter` configuration might need adjustment to prevent re-declaration. (No current plans for this).

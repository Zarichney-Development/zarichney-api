**Last Updated:** 2025-04-18

> **Parent:** [`Controllers`](../README.md)
> **Related:**
> * **Source:** [`ApiController.cs`](../../../../api-server/Controllers/ApiController.cs)
> * **Standards:** [`TestingStandards.md`](../../../../Docs/Standards/TestingStandards.md), [`DocumentationStandards.md`](../../../../Docs/Development/DocumentationStandards.md)

## 1. Purpose & Rationale (Why?)

These tests aim to verify any **internal helper methods or shared, non-trivial logic within the `ApiController` base class in isolation**.

* **Why Unit Tests?** If `ApiController` contains protected or public helper methods used by derived controllers (e.g., for creating standardized responses, performing common validation), unit tests provide fast feedback that this shared logic is correct, independent of any specific derived controller's context.
* **Why Mock Dependencies?** Any dependencies injected directly into `ApiController` would need to be mocked to isolate the logic being tested.

## 2. Scope & Key Functionality Tested (What?)

These tests focus *only* on methods defined directly within `ApiController`:

* **Potential Scope:**
    * Protected helper methods (e.g., `CreateErrorResponse`, `ValidateInputCommon`).
    * Complex property logic (if any).
    * Base constructor logic (if it does more than just assign dependencies).
* **Current Assessment:** Review `ApiController.cs` to identify specific methods containing logic complex enough to warrant isolated unit testing. If it primarily contains attributes and dependency assignments, dedicated unit tests may not provide significant value beyond the tests of derived classes.

## 3. Test Environment Setup

* **Instantiation:** If testing protected members, a simple concrete test class inheriting from `ApiController` might be needed within the test project. Alternatively, mocking frameworks might allow testing protected methods directly if configured appropriately.
* **Mocking:** Any dependencies required by the `ApiController` constructor or the specific methods under test must be mocked (e.g., using Moq).

## 4. Maintenance Notes & Troubleshooting

* **Adding Shared Logic:** If new, non-trivial helper methods or logic are added to `ApiController`, consider adding corresponding unit tests here to verify them in isolation before they are used by derived controllers.
* **Refactoring:** When refactoring derived controllers, if common logic is extracted into `ApiController`, ensure unit tests are created or updated here.
* **Test Failures:** Failures likely indicate issues in the shared logic within `ApiController` itself or incorrect mock setups for its direct dependencies.

## 5. Test Cases & TODOs

* **TODO:** Review `ApiController.cs` for any protected/public methods with logic suitable for unit testing (e.g., helper methods).
* **TODO:** If testable methods exist, add specific TODOs for each (e.g., `TODO: Test CreateStandardErrorResponse formats output correctly.`).
* **TODO (If no testable logic):** Add note: "No specific unit tests planned as the base class primarily contains attributes/declarations or simple pass-through logic tested via derived classes."

## 6. Changelog

* **2025-04-18:** Initial creation - Defined purpose and scope for potential `ApiController` unit tests. (Gemini)

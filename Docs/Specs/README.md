## 1. Purpose & Responsibility

* **What it is:** Central repository for all project specifications including epic specifications, feature specifications, and component specifications that guide development and provide architectural decision records.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Epic specification documentation and navigation
  - Feature specification templates and storage
  - Component specification templates and archives
  - Historical specification lookup and reference
  - Standardized specification templates for consistent documentation
* **Why it exists:** To provide a standardized location for all project specifications that enables comprehensive historical lookups, supports architectural decision tracking, and ensures consistent specification documentation across the project lifecycle.

### Epic Specifications
* **Epic #181:** [`Build Workflows Enhancement`](./epic-181-build-workflows/README.md) - CI/CD workflow improvements and automation enhancements
* **Epic #246:** [`LanguageModelService v2 Multi-Provider AI Architecture`](./epic-246-language-model-service/README.md) - Vendor-agnostic Language Model Service transformation with multi-provider support

## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

* **High-Level Design:** Three-tier specification hierarchy: Epic → Feature → Component, with each level providing appropriate detail granularity and cross-references to related specifications.
* **Core Logic Flow:**
  1. Epic specifications capture high-level objectives and success criteria
  2. Feature specifications define implementation approach for epic components
  3. Component specifications detail technical implementation and integration patterns
  4. Template system ensures consistency across all specification types
* **Key Data Structures:**
  - `TEMPLATE-epic-spec.md` - Standardized epic specification template
  - `TEMPLATE-feature-spec.md` - Standardized feature specification template
  - `TEMPLATE-component-spec.md` - Standardized component specification template
* **State Management:** Specifications maintained as versioned markdown files with embedded Mermaid diagrams and cross-reference linking structure

## 3. Interface Contract & Assumptions

* **Key Public Interfaces (for external consumers):**
  - **Epic Specification Access:** Navigate to epic-specific directories for comprehensive epic documentation
  - **Template Access:** Use template files as basis for new specifications
  - **Historical Lookup:** Search specifications by epic number, feature area, or component name
  - **Cross-Reference Navigation:** Follow relative links between related specifications

* **Critical Assumptions:**
  - All specifications follow DocumentationStandards.md requirements for structure and linking
  - Epic specifications provide complete context for downstream feature and component specifications
  - Template adherence ensures consistent specification quality and navigation patterns
  - Specifications maintained concurrent with development work to ensure accuracy

## 4. Local Conventions & Constraints (Beyond Global Standards)

* **Configuration:** No special configuration required - specifications are static markdown files
* **Directory Structure:**
  - `/epic-[number]-[description]/` - Epic-specific specification directories
  - `/epic-[number]-[description]/components/` - Component specifications for each epic
  - `TEMPLATE-*.md` files at root level for specification creation
* **Naming Conventions:**
  - Epic directories: `epic-[number]-[description]` (e.g., `epic-181-build-workflows`)
  - Template files: `TEMPLATE-[type]-spec.md` format
  - Component specifications: descriptive names within epic components directories
* **Documentation Standards:** All specifications must comply with DocumentationStandards.md for linking, structure, and Mermaid diagram usage

## 5. How to Work With This Code

* **Setup:** No special setup required - standard markdown editing and documentation review tools
* **Testing:**
  - **Location:** No automated testing - specifications validated through peer review and implementation validation
  - **Validation Strategy:** Ensure specifications accurately reflect system behavior and architectural decisions
  - **Cross-Reference Verification:** Validate all relative links function correctly across specification network
* **Common Pitfalls / Gotchas:**
  - Specifications must be kept current with implementation changes
  - Epic specifications should provide sufficient context for feature and component specifications
  - Template usage ensures consistency but specifications should be tailored to specific context

## 6. Dependencies

* **Internal Code Dependencies:**
  - [`Docs/Standards`](../Standards/README.md) - Documentation standards and requirements
  - [`Docs/Templates`](../Templates/README.md) - Template patterns and structure guidelines

* **External Library Dependencies:**
  - Mermaid.js for diagram rendering in documentation tools
  - Standard markdown rendering for specification display

* **Dependents (Impact of Changes):**
  - Development teams reference specifications for implementation guidance
  - Architecture decisions documented in specifications inform system design
  - Epic progression tracking relies on specification accuracy and currency

## 7. Rationale & Key Historical Context

* **Centralized Specification Management:** Provides single source of truth for all project specifications rather than scattered documentation across multiple locations
* **Template-Driven Consistency:** Standardized templates ensure consistent specification quality and enable efficient specification creation and review
* **Epic-Centric Organization:** Epic-based directory structure aligns with project management and enables comprehensive epic documentation and tracking

## 8. Known Issues & TODOs

* Component specification template needs development based on Epic #181 component analysis patterns
* Feature specification template requires definition based on project feature development patterns
* Cross-reference validation automation could improve specification network integrity
* Specification currency validation process needs establishment for ongoing maintenance

# Epic #181: AI-Powered CI/CD Orchestration Framework

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-23
**Version:** 1.0
**Epic Context:** AI-Powered CI/CD Orchestration Framework
**Status:** Vision Documented - Implementation Ready

> **Parent:** [`Epic #181 Build Workflows`](./README.md)

## 1. Purpose & Responsibility

* **What it is:** Comprehensive AI-powered CI/CD orchestration framework that provides universal build pipelines with configurable AI integration, enabling unlimited autonomous development workstreams with branch-aware AI behaviors and intelligent work discovery.
* **Key Objectives:**
  - **Primary: Universal AI Orchestration** - Create configurable CI/CD framework supporting any branch pattern with appropriate AI integration
  - **Branch-Aware AI Selection** - Different branches receive different AI behaviors (sentinels, iterative review, generic review)
  - **Multi-Epic Autonomous Support** - Enable unlimited epic workflows with specialized AI agents and work discovery
  - **Non-Blocking Build Philosophy** - AI missions can work on broken code while AI reviews require working builds
  - **Intelligent Work Discovery** - Pluggable work source adapters for coverage reports, GitHub issues, performance metrics, etc.
  - **Cost-Controlled Iteration** - Configurable iteration limits and auto-merge criteria per branch type
* **Success Criteria:**
  - **Universal Branch Support** - Any branch gets appropriate AI integration without configuration changes
  - **Multi-Epic Scaling** - Support for coverage, tech debt, performance, security, and custom autonomous workstreams
  - **Intelligent Cost Management** - Expensive AI operations only where configured with proper controls
  - **Self-Healing Workflows** - AI missions can diagnose and fix broken builds automatically
  - **Configurable Quality Gates** - Per-branch quality standards with automated enforcement
* **Why it exists:** To create a scalable, intelligent CI/CD framework that eliminates manual coordination overhead while providing appropriate AI integration for every development scenario, from simple feature branches to complex autonomous epic workflows.

> **Expanded Vision:** This framework transforms Epic #181 from build workflow standardization into a comprehensive AI-powered development orchestration system supporting unlimited autonomous workstreams.

### Execution Topology

* **Default-Branch Dispatcher:** Cron-based workflow that reads the configuration registry, finds matching epic branches, and launches mission workflows with the correct prompts and context.
* **Mission Workflows:** Branch-specific YAML definitions that inherit the base build steps, run them with advisory failure handling, and execute AI builders/fixers against draft PRs.
* **Review Workflows:** PR-triggered YAML definitions that reuse the same foundation but require passing builds/tests before running review AI and producing merge checklists.
* **Generic Review:** Lightweight fallback workflow that applies a single-pass review to branches without bespoke behavior.
* **Shared Artifacts:** Coverage diffs, test logs, and review TODO lists persist between workflows so the dispatcher can resume partial work.

```yaml
Concurrency_Controls:
  global_ai_operations:
    group: "ai-operations-global"
    cancel_in_progress: false
    max_parallel: 2  # Prevent resource exhaustion

  per_epic_missions:
    group: "ai-mission-coverage-{branch}"
    cancel_in_progress: false  # Allow scheduled missions to complete

  scheduler_controller:
    group: "ai-orchestration-scheduler"
    cancel_in_progress: true   # New discovery cancels old

Resource_Management:
  mission_workflow_limits:
    max_parallel: 2

```

### 4.2 Configuration Registry Integration

* **Dynamic Configuration Loading:** Python-based configuration loader (`config-loader.py`) provides branch pattern matching and behavior selection
* **YAML Configuration Structure:** Centralized configuration file (`ai-orchestration-config.yml`) defines branch patterns, AI behaviors, quality gates, and cost controls
* **Runtime Behavior Selection:** Workflows dynamically load appropriate AI configuration based on branch patterns without manual configuration
* **Validation and Fallbacks:** Configuration syntax validation with graceful degradation to default behaviors

### 4.3 Artifact-Based Storage Strategy

```yaml
Artifact_Management:
  mission_artifacts:
    name: "ai-mission-artifacts-{run_number}"
    content: ["coverage_reports", "analysis_results", "failure_context"]
    retention: "7 days"

  review_artifacts:
    name: "ai-review-artifacts-{pr_number}"
    content: ["review_results", "quality_assessments", "approval_status"]
    retention: "30 days"

  cross_workflow_state:
    mechanism: "GitHub API + artifact storage"
    persistence: "Mission status, work discovery, iteration tracking"
    coordination: "Scheduler reads artifacts to resume partial work"
```

## 5. Mission vs Review Execution Semantics

### 5.1 Mission Execution (Non-Blocking Philosophy)

```yaml
Mission_Characteristics:
  continue_on_error: true  # Can work on broken builds
  failure_handling: "advisory - log but continue"
  quality_gates: "epic-level standards"
  auto_merge: "enabled with AI review success"

Implementation_Pattern:
  foundation_steps:
    environment_setup: "required - failure terminates mission"
    dependency_resolution: "continue-on-error: true"
    build_execution: "continue-on-error: true"
    test_execution: "continue-on-error: true"

  ai_execution:
    work_discovery: "always execute regardless of foundation status"
    ai_development: "can diagnose and fix foundation failures"
    draft_pr_creation: "even with test failures"

  scheduled_trigger_handling:
    quota_window_classification: "skipped_quota_window during subscription refresh"
    manual_vs_scheduled: "different failure semantics"
    retry_logic: "automatic retry on next scheduler cycle"
```

### 5.2 Review Execution (Blocking Validation)

```yaml
Review_Characteristics:
  continue_on_error: false  # Requires working builds
  failure_handling: "blocking - must pass foundation"
  quality_gates: "branch-appropriate standards"
  auto_merge: "manual approval required"

Implementation_Pattern:
  foundation_validation:
    build_success: "required for AI review"
    test_success: "required for AI review"
    coverage_threshold: "branch-pattern dependent"

  pr_state_management:
    foundation_failure: "convert PR to draft automatically"
    foundation_success: "mark PR ready for review"
    manual_override: "/ai-review-override comment support"

  blocking_semantics:
    failed_foundation: "AI review skipped entirely"
    annotation_strategy: "clear failure reasons with remediation steps"
```

### 5.3 PR Draft Conversion Logic

```yaml
Draft_Conversion_Triggers:
  automatic_draft_conversion:
    foundation_failure: "build or test failures"
    security_scan_failure: "critical security issues"
    coverage_regression: "below branch-pattern threshold"

  ready_for_review_triggers:
    foundation_success: "all foundation steps pass"
    ai_review_completion: "positive AI analysis"
    manual_override: "developer /ready command"

  notification_strategy:
    draft_conversion: "automated comment with failure context"
    ready_conversion: "automated comment with review summary"
    manual_override_available: "clear instructions for bypass"
```

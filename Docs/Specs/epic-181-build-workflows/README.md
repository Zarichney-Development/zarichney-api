# Epic #181: AI-Powered CI/CD Orchestration Framework

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-23
**Epic Status:** Implementation Documentation Complete - Ready for Deployment
**Epic Owner:** Zarichney-Development Team

> **Parent:** [`Specs`](../README.md)

## 1. Purpose & Responsibility

* **What it is:** Universal AI-powered CI/CD orchestration framework that provides intelligent, branch-aware build pipelines with configurable AI integration, enabling unlimited autonomous development workstreams through dynamic behavior selection and pluggable work discovery via a coordinated set of GitHub Actions workflows.
* **Key Objectives:**
  - **Primary: Universal AI Orchestration** - Create configurable CI/CD framework supporting any branch pattern with appropriate AI integration
  - **Branch-Aware Intelligence** - Different branches receive different AI behaviors (sentinels, iterative review, generic review) automatically
  - **Multi-Epic Autonomous Support** - Enable unlimited epic workflows with specialized AI agents and intelligent work discovery
  - **Non-Blocking Build Philosophy** - AI missions can work on broken code while AI reviews require working builds
  - **Intelligent Work Discovery** - Pluggable work source adapters for coverage reports, GitHub issues, performance metrics, etc.
  - **Cost-Controlled Operations** - Configurable iteration limits and auto-merge criteria with intelligent resource optimization
  - **Universal Branch Support** - Every branch gets appropriate AI integration without per-branch reconfiguration, using a shared configuration file plus dedicated workflow definitions (base build, mission, review, generic)
* **Success Criteria:**
  - **Universal Framework Deployment** - Any branch receives appropriate AI integration automatically through configuration-driven orchestration rather than bespoke workflow files
  - **Multi-Epic Scaling Validation** - Support for coverage, tech debt, performance, security, and custom autonomous workstreams
  - **Intelligent Cost Management** - AI operations optimized with usage monitoring and automatic cost controls
  - **Self-Healing Capabilities** - AI missions can diagnose and fix broken builds with autonomous recovery
  - **Quality Gate Excellence** - Per-branch quality standards with automated enforcement and escalation
  - **Developer Experience Optimization** - Transparent AI integration without workflow disruption or configuration burden
* **Why it exists:** To create a scalable, intelligent CI/CD framework that eliminates manual coordination overhead while providing appropriate AI integration for every development scenario, enabling organizational scaling through intelligent automation rather than additional human resources.

### Workflow Composition

* **Base Build Validation (`build-base.yml`):** Runs on every push/PR to enforce syntax, dependency, and test checks. Provides the artifacts consumed by other workflows.
* **Mission Workflow (`mission-*.yml`):** Triggered by the default-branch dispatcher on a schedule. Checks out the configured epic branch, runs the base steps with `continue-on-error`, and hands diagnostic context to the AI builder/fixer.
* **Review Workflow (`review-*.yml`):** Runs on ready-for-review pull requests. Shares the same setup but blocks on any foundation failure, flips the PR to draft when issues appear, and executes the review AI once the base steps pass.
* **Generic Review (`pr-generic-review.yml`):** Provides the fallback single-pass review for branches without bespoke behavior. Loads configuration defaults and ensures consistent coverage of new PRs.
* **Dispatcher (`scheduler-controller.yml`):** Lives on the default branch, owns cron triggers, locates eligible draft PRs, and dispatches mission workflows according to the configuration registry.

> **Architectural Foundation:** See [02 - Architectural Assessment](./02-architectural-assessment.md) for comprehensive system design validation and component boundary analysis.
* **Core Implementation Flow:**
  1. Pull request triggers comprehensive validation pipeline
  2. Parallel execution of build, test, and security analysis workflows
  3. Automated deployment to staging environment upon merge to develop
  4. Production deployment with manual approval gates and automated rollback
  5. Continuous monitoring and alerting throughout deployment lifecycle
* **Key Architectural Decisions:**
  - GitHub Actions as primary CI/CD platform for consistency with existing tooling
  - Multi-environment deployment strategy with environment-specific configurations
  - Containerized build processes for consistency and reproducibility
  - Integrated security scanning with automatic vulnerability reporting
  - Workflow observability with metrics collection and alerting

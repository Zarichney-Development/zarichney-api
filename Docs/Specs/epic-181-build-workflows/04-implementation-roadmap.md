### 3.4 Issue #220: Coverage Epic Merge Orchestrator AI Compatibility 🚧 **BLOCKING**

**Objective**: Restore the Coverage Epic Merge Orchestrator's AI conflict resolution capability after `anthropics/claude-code-action@eap` removed support for `mode: 'remote-agent'` during workflow_dispatch runs on `main` (Run #24 failure).

**Key Tasks**:
1. Update `.github/workflows/coverage-epic-merge-orchestrator.yml` to use a supported action mode (`agent` or repository_dispatch triggered) and modern authentication inputs.
2. Align `.github/prompts/coverage-epic-merge-orchestrator.md` with the revised execution flow and tool permissions.
3. Refresh `Docs/Development/CoverageEpicMergeOrchestration.md` and Epic #181 specifications with the new conflict resolution procedure.
4. Execute a non-dry-run orchestrator workflow on `main` that encounters at least one merge conflict and confirm the AI step completes with zero remaining PRs.

**Dependencies**:
- Blocks Issues #185-#187 until sequential merging completes successfully with the updated configuration.
- Coordinates with Epic #94 automation to maintain deterministic merge ordering and rollback safeguards.

**Validation Requirements**:
- Workflow run artifacts demonstrating the successful AI conflict resolution step.
- Removal of deprecated secrets (`claude_access_token`, `claude_refresh_token`, `claude_expires_at`) from workflow inputs.
- Documentation updates committed alongside the workflow change.

### 3.5 Issue #156: Autonomous Cycle Completion - Epic Capstone ⭐ **CAPSTONE**

**Objective**: Complete the autonomous development cycle by implementing auto-trigger integration between Coverage Epic Automation and Coverage Epic Merge Orchestrator, eliminating the final manual intervention point.

**Epic Capstone Status**: This issue completes Epic #181's vision of fully autonomous development workflows by closing the automation loop - when AI code review approves a PR for merging, the system automatically triggers the next development cycle without manual intervention.

**Key Tasks**:
1. Implement `workflow_run` trigger in `coverage-epic-merge-orchestrator.yml` to auto-trigger after Coverage Epic Automation completion
2. Add validation logic to prevent unnecessary orchestrator runs when no PRs exist for consolidation
3. Standardize naming conventions across all Coverage Epic workflows ("Automated Workflow - Auto-Testing Coverage - [Component]")
4. Implement git configuration standardization with `bot@zarichney.com` email and descriptive usernames

**Dependencies**:
- Requires Issue #220 resolution for AI conflict resolution capability
- Completes the autonomous cycle enabling Issues #185-#187 to operate within fully autonomous framework

**Validation Requirements**:
- End-to-end autonomous cycle demonstration from scheduler trigger to automatic restart
- Zero manual intervention required throughout development cycle
- Successful auto-trigger integration with proper conditional logic

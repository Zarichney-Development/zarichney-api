## 11. Next Actions & Epic Activation

### 11.1 Immediate Implementation Priorities

**Foundation Phase Activation (Next 1-2 Days)**:
1. **CodeChanger**: Begin path-analysis component extraction with WorkflowEngineer coordination
2. **WorkflowEngineer**: Implement concurrency-config component with resource optimization
3. **SecurityAuditor**: Validate security control implementation for foundation components
4. **TestEngineer**: Establish component testing framework and validation procedures

### 11.2 Epic Coordination Activation

**Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol**:
```yaml
Epic_Leadership:
  Claude_Orchestration: "Strategic oversight and adaptive coordination throughout epic"
  Team_Integration: "Working directory communication and artifact management"
  Quality_Gates: "Progress monitoring and course correction as needed"

Implementation_Coordination:
  Daily_Progress_Assessment: "Component extraction progress and integration status"
  Security_Validation_Checkpoints: "Ongoing security requirement verification"
  Architecture_Compliance_Review: "SOLID principles and design pattern adherence"
  Epic_Progression_Monitoring: "Issues #183, #188, #184-#187 advancement tracking"
```

### 11.3 Epic Success Framework

### Two-Phase Implementation Strategy

Epic #181 implements autonomous development through a strategic two-phase approach:

```yaml
Phase_1_Vision_ACTIVE:
  From: "Manual coverage development coordination"
  To: "Autonomous coverage development with AI-powered quality assurance"

Phase_1_Coverage_Focus:
  Coverage_Development: "Autonomous test creation targeting coverage gaps"
  Quality_Review: "AI-powered iterative review ensuring high standards"
  Coverage_Progression: "Systematic advancement toward 90% backend goal"
  Stability_Proof: "Weeks/months of robust autonomous operation"

Phase_2_Vision_FUTURE:
  From: "Proven coverage autonomous workflow"
  To: "Universal framework supporting unlimited autonomous workstreams"

Phase_2_Universal_Support:
  Multi_Epic_Workstreams: "Coverage, tech debt, performance, security autonomous cycles"
  Branch_Aware_Intelligence: "Configurable AI behavior based on branch patterns"
  Pluggable_Work_Discovery: "Adaptive work source integration for diverse contexts"
  Zero_Configuration_Scaling: "Automatic activation for any epic pattern"
```

### Mission vs. Review Execution Rules

* **Scheduled mission workflows (AI builders/fixers):** Always bootstrap the full environment, run dependency installation, build, and tests, but treat those steps as advisory. Failures are captured as context for the agent rather than failing the workflow so the bot can diagnose the broken state. Missions target draft pull requests that match the branch pattern defined in configuration and will resume the most recent draft when a run begins.
* **PR review workflows:** Triggered by a ready-for-review pull request. The same environment setup and validation steps execute, but failures are blocking; if build or tests fail, the workflow flips the PR back to draft, records the failure signal for the next mission run, and skips AI review.
* **Quality gatekeeper:** Once validation passes, the review AI produces a checklist. The PR cannot exit draft or merge until the checklist is cleared by subsequent mission runs and the review AI emits a passing status.

## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

* **High-Level Design:** Six-phase autonomous cycle orchestrated through GitHub Actions specifically for coverage epic development - Phase 1 implementation establishing foundation for future universal framework capabilities.

### Phase Interaction and State Management

* **Scheduler Orchestration:** A default-branch controller workflow owns the cron trigger, locates the matching epic branch, and decides whether to create a fresh mission branch or resume the most recent draft pull request.
* **State Persistence:** Each run stores hand-off artifacts (coverage diffs, failing test logs, review checklists) so the next phase can resume contextually.
* **Error Recovery:** Built-in retry mechanisms and failure escalation paths preserve cycle integrity without abandoning partially complete work.
* **Progress Tracking:** Continuous assessment of epic progression (90% backend coverage goal) guides cycle prioritization.
* **Quality Enforcement:** AI-powered iterative improvement ensures all deliverables meet standards before progression.

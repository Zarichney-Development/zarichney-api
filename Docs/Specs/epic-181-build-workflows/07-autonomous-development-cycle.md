**Last Updated:** 2025-09-22
**Version:** 1.0
**Epic Context:** Build Workflows Enhancement & Autonomous Development Cycle
**Status:** Foundation Complete - Implementation Sequence Defined

> **Parent:** [`Epic #181 Build Workflows`](./README.md)

## 1. Purpose & Responsibility

* **What it is:** Comprehensive specification for Epic #181's autonomous development cycle - a fully automated workflow ecosystem that handles the complete development lifecycle from test creation through deployment without manual intervention.
* **Key Objectives:**
  - **Primary: Complete Automation Loop** - Establish 6-phase autonomous cycle handling test development, code review, conflict resolution, and deployment
  - **Intelligent AI Integration** - Deploy sophisticated AI-powered analysis, iteration management, and quality enforcement
  - **Scalable Foundation** - Create patterns applicable to tech debt remediation, performance optimization, and security hardening workstreams
  - **Zero-Touch Operations** - Enable development progression through scheduled automation with human oversight only for strategic decisions
* **Success Criteria:**
  - **Fully Autonomous Test Development Cycle** - Complete 6-hour scheduled cycles creating, reviewing, and merging test coverage improvements
  - **AI-Powered Quality Enforcement** - Iterative code review with automated improvement cycles until quality standards achieved
  - **Intelligent Conflict Resolution** - Automated conflict detection and resolution across multiple concurrent PRs
  - **Epic Progression Automation** - Seamless progression toward 90% backend coverage goal through coordinated automation
* **Why it exists:** To establish the foundational pattern for autonomous development that eliminates manual coordination overhead while maintaining quality standards, enabling the organization to scale development capabilities through intelligent automation rather than additional human resources.

> **Implementation Foundation:** Built upon comprehensive AI framework from Issue #184 (ai-sentinel-base, ai-testing-analysis, ai-standards-analysis) and foundation components from Issues #183 and #212.

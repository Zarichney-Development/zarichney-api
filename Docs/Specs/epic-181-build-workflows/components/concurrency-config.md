## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

* **Technical Design:** Reusable GitHub Actions configuration providing standardized concurrency group definitions, cancellation policies, and resource optimization patterns implemented as shared configuration templates.

* **Implementation Logic Flow:**
  1. Define workflow-specific concurrency groups based on branch patterns and workflow types
  2. Apply appropriate cancellation policies for different execution contexts (feature, epic, main)
  3. Configure resource allocation optimization for parallel execution and cost efficiency
  4. Enable epic coordination patterns with conflict prevention and proper resource sharing
  5. Provide specialized configurations for coverage workflows and AI analysis execution

* **Key Technical Elements:**
  - **Concurrency Group Management**: Branch-aware grouping preventing conflicts while enabling parallelization
  - **Cancellation Policy Engine**: Intelligent cancellation based on workflow type and execution context
  - **Resource Optimization Framework**: GitHub Actions runner allocation and utilization optimization
  - **Epic Coordination Patterns**: Multi-workflow resource sharing and conflict prevention
  - **Specialized Execution Configs**: Coverage-specific and AI analysis resource management

* **Data Structures:**
  - Input: Branch type, workflow type, execution context, resource requirements
  - Output: Concurrency group identifier, cancellation policy, resource allocation configuration
  - Internal: Branch pattern matching, workflow classification, resource allocation rules

* **Processing Pipeline:** Branch analysis → Workflow classification → Concurrency group assignment → Cancellation policy application → Resource optimization configuration

## 1. Purpose & Responsibility

* **What it is:** GitHub Actions component providing comprehensive .NET backend build execution with coverage flexibility, zero-warning enforcement, and specialized testing integration supporting both main builds and coverage-focused workflows.

* **Key Technical Responsibilities:**
  - Execute .NET solution build with configurable coverage collection and warning enforcement
  - Integrate with Testcontainers for database test execution with security isolation
  - Provide flexible build artifact management and comprehensive error handling
  - Support testing-coverage-build-review.yml specialization while maintaining zero-warning policy compliance

* **Implementation Success Criteria:**
  - Build execution produces identical results to current build.yml backend build logic
  - Coverage collection integration supports unified test suite execution patterns
  - Zero-warning policy enforcement maintains existing quality gates with environment-aware flexibility
  - Performance optimization through selective execution and resource management

* **Why it exists:** Enables both main build pipeline and specialized testing-coverage-build-review.yml workflows to leverage consistent .NET build patterns while supporting Epic #181's modular architecture and coverage goal progression.

## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

* **Technical Design:** Composite GitHub Action implementing .NET build pipeline with configurable coverage, warning enforcement, and test integration, leveraging existing shared actions for environment setup and test validation.

* **Implementation Logic Flow:**
  1. Validate input parameters and environment configuration for build requirements
  2. Setup .NET environment using existing setup-environment shared action
  3. Execute solution build with configurable warning-as-error enforcement
  4. Run test suite with optional coverage collection using validate-test-suite integration
  5. Process build artifacts and generate structured output for workflow consumption
  6. Handle failures with appropriate error reporting and artifact preservation

* **Key Technical Elements:**
  - **Build Execution Engine**: .NET solution compilation with MSBuild integration
  - **Coverage Collection Framework**: Configurable test coverage analysis supporting epic goals
  - **Warning Enforcement System**: Zero-warning policy with environment-aware flexibility
  - **Test Integration Layer**: Testcontainers database testing with security isolation
  - **Artifact Management**: Build output handling and structured result reporting

* **Data Structures:**
  - Input: Solution path, coverage configuration, warning enforcement settings, test filters
  - Output: Build status, warning counts, coverage results, artifact paths, error details
  - Internal: MSBuild parameters, test execution context, coverage data processing

* **Processing Pipeline:** Parameter validation → Environment setup → Build execution → Test execution → Coverage collection → Artifact processing → Result reporting

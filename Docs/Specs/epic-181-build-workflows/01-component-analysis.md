## 1. Purpose & Executive Summary

This specification provides comprehensive component analysis of the current `.github/workflows/build.yml` workflow to enable Epic #181 standardization goals. The analysis identifies 23 distinct reusable components across 4 major categories, with clear extraction priorities enabling seamless progression through issues #183-#187.

**Key Findings**:
- **23 Extractable Components** across Build/Test, AI Analysis, Security, and Infrastructure categories
- **7 Existing Shared Actions** provide foundation for component integration
- **5 AI Sentinels** with sophisticated prompt engineering require specialized extraction
- **Branch-Aware Architecture** supports feature→epic→develop→main progression patterns
- **Zero-Warning Policy** enforcement must be preserved across all extractions

**Current State**: Monolithic "mega build pipeline" (962 lines) that consolidates all CI/CD capabilities into a single workflow. While functionally comprehensive, this structure creates maintenance challenges and blocks Epic #181's standardization goals.

    epic_context: 'epic-181-build-workflows'
```

## 3. Canonical Pattern for Issues #185-#187

### 3.1 Foundation Component Consumption Pattern

**Reference Implementation Established**: Issue #212's refactored build.yml provides the standard approach for all Epic #181 workflows.

#### Core Integration Principles
1. **Replace Inline Logic**: Use foundation components for repeated patterns
2. **Interface Mapping**: Preserve downstream compatibility through output mapping
3. **Legacy Compatibility**: Maintain existing step IDs and output formats
4. **Documentation**: Document component integration and behavioral preservation

#### Foundation Component Integration Template
```yaml
# Step 1: Foundation Component Consumption
- name: Execute [component-name] with foundation component
  id: foundation-[component-name]
  uses: ./.github/actions/shared/[component-name]
  with:
    # Component-specific inputs

# Step 2: Interface Mapping for Legacy Compatibility
- name: Map foundation outputs to legacy interface
  id: [legacy-step-id]  # ← CRITICAL: Preserve existing step ID
  run: |
    # Map foundation outputs to existing interface names
    echo "[legacy-output]=${{ steps.foundation-[component-name].outputs.[foundation-output] }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  outputs:
    [legacy-output]: ${{ steps.foundation-[component-name].outputs.[foundation-output] }}
```

### 3.2 Reusable Integration Patterns

#### Path Analysis Pattern
```yaml
# Foundation component execution
- name: Execute path analysis with foundation component
  id: foundation-path-analysis
  uses: ./.github/actions/shared/path-analysis
  with:
    base_ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha || 'develop' }}

# Legacy interface mapping
- name: Map foundation outputs to build.yml interface
  id: path-analysis
  run: |
    echo "backend-changed=${{ steps.foundation-path-analysis.outputs.has_backend_changes }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    echo "frontend-changed=${{ steps.foundation-path-analysis.outputs.has_frontend_changes }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    echo "docs-only=${{ steps.foundation-path-analysis.outputs.has_docs_changes }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  outputs:
    backend-changed: ${{ steps.foundation-path-analysis.outputs.has_backend_changes }}
    frontend-changed: ${{ steps.foundation-path-analysis.outputs.has_frontend_changes }}
    docs-only: ${{ steps.foundation-path-analysis.outputs.has_docs_changes }}
```

#### Backend Build Pattern
```yaml
# Foundation component execution
- name: Execute backend build with foundation component
  id: foundation-backend-build
  uses: ./.github/actions/shared/backend-build
  with:
    solution_path: 'zarichney-api.sln'
    coverage_enabled: true
    warning_as_error: true

# Legacy interface mapping with step ID preservation
- name: Map foundation outputs to legacy interface
  id: backend-execution  # ← CRITICAL: Preserves existing step ID
  run: |
    echo "build_success=${{ steps.foundation-backend-build.outputs.build_success }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    echo "warning_count=${{ steps.foundation-backend-build.outputs.warning_count }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  outputs:
    build_success: ${{ steps.foundation-backend-build.outputs.build_success }}
    warning_count: ${{ steps.foundation-backend-build.outputs.warning_count }}
    test_success: ${{ steps.foundation-backend-build.outputs.test_success }}
    coverage_percentage: ${{ steps.foundation-backend-build.outputs.coverage_percentage }}
```

### 3.3 Error Handling and Annotation Compatibility

#### Foundation Component Error Analysis
```yaml
# Error type analysis for annotation compatibility
- name: Analyze foundation component errors for annotation step
  if: always() && steps.foundation-backend-build.outputs.error_details
  run: |
    error_details="${{ steps.foundation-backend-build.outputs.error_details }}"
    if [[ "$error_details" == *"warnings"* ]]; then
      echo "error_type=warnings" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    elif [[ "$error_details" == *"compilation"* ]]; then
      echo "error_type=compilation" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "error_type=unknown" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi
  id: error-analysis
  outputs:
    error_type: ${{ steps.error-analysis.outputs.error_type }}
```

## 4. Issue #184 Implementation Guidance

### 4.1 testing-coverage-build-review.yml Creation Using Canonical Pattern

**Implementation Approach**: Use Issue #212's canonical pattern as the foundation for testing-coverage-build-review.yml creation.

#### Required Adaptations for Coverage Workflow
1. **Path Analysis**: Use same foundation component with coverage-focused filtering
2. **Backend Build**: Use same foundation component with coverage-specific configuration
3. **Coverage Intelligence**: Add AI framework components for iterative coverage analysis
4. **Interface Preservation**: Maintain compatibility with existing test infrastructure

#### Coverage-Specific Enhancements
```yaml
# Coverage-focused path analysis
- name: Execute path analysis for coverage workflow
  uses: ./.github/actions/shared/path-analysis
  with:
    base_ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha || 'develop' }}
    focus_mode: 'coverage-analysis'  # Coverage-specific filtering

# Coverage-enabled backend build
- name: Execute backend build with coverage optimization
  uses: ./.github/actions/shared/backend-build
  with:
    solution_path: 'zarichney-api.sln'
    coverage_enabled: true
    coverage_threshold: 16  # Epic #181 coverage requirements
    test_filter: 'Category=Unit|Category=Integration'
```

### 4.2 AI Framework Integration Pattern ✅ **ESTABLISHED**

#### Complete AI Framework Integration (Issue #184 Achievement)
**AI Framework Pattern**: The testing-coverage-build-review.yml workflow successfully demonstrates the complete AI framework integration pattern for all future Epic #181 workflows.

```yaml
# Complete AI Framework Integration Pattern (Established in testing-coverage-build-review.yml)
- name: AI Coverage Intelligence
  if: always() && !cancelled() && needs.coverage-analysis.outputs.ai-framework-ready == 'true'
  uses: ./.github/actions/shared/ai-testing-analysis
  with:
    coverage_data: ${{ needs.coverage-analysis.outputs.coverage-percentage }}
    baseline_coverage: ${{ needs.coverage-analysis.outputs.coverage-baseline }}

    openai_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}

- name: AI Analysis Summary
  if: always() && !cancelled() && (needs.ai-coverage-analysis.result == 'success' || needs.ai-standards-analysis.result == 'success')
  uses: ./.github/actions/shared/ai-sentinel-base
  with:
    analysis_type: 'summary'
    template_path: '.github/prompts/ai-analysis-summary.md'
    context_data: |
      {
        "coverage_analysis": "${{ needs.ai-coverage-analysis.outputs.coverage_analysis }}",
        "standards_analysis": "${{ needs.ai-standards-analysis.outputs.standards_analysis }}",
        "improvement_recommendations": "${{ needs.ai-coverage-analysis.outputs.improvement_recommendations }}",
        "compliance_score": "${{ needs.ai-standards-analysis.outputs.compliance_score }}"
      }
```

#### AI Framework Security Controls Integration
**Security Pattern**: All AI framework components inherit comprehensive security controls from ai-sentinel-base:
- **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Strict template validation and sanitization
- **Context Security**: Secure placeholder replacement with input filtering
- **Authentication Security**: Secure AI service token handling and rotation
- **Result Integrity**: AI analysis output validation and tampering detection

### 4.3 Integration with Existing Infrastructure

#### Preserve AI Sentinel Compatibility
- All 5 AI Sentinels continue functioning with same input interfaces
- Foundation component outputs mapped to preserve existing conditional logic
- Job dependencies maintained through interface mapping layers
- Artifact management preserved through foundation component automation

## 5. Technical Implementation Details

### 5.1 Interface Mapping Strategy

**Critical Success Factor**: Interface mapping enables foundation components to provide enhanced functionality while preserving exact downstream compatibility.

#### Output Name Mapping Approach
```yaml
# Foundation outputs → Legacy interface preservation
Legacy_Interface_Name: ${{ steps.foundation-component.outputs.Foundation_Output_Name }}
```

#### Complex Data Structure Mapping
```yaml
# For complex outputs requiring format preservation
- name: Transform foundation output to legacy format
  run: |
    foundation_data="${{ steps.foundation-component.outputs.complex_data }}"
    # Transform to legacy CSV format for backward compatibility
    legacy_format=$(echo "$foundation_data" | jq -r 'map(.) | join(",")')
    echo "changed-files=$legacy_format" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

### 5.2 Workflow-Level Construct Preservation

#### Concurrency Configuration
```yaml
# Concurrency remains at workflow level - cannot be extracted to components
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.ref != 'refs/heads/main' && github.ref != 'refs/heads/develop' }}
```

#### Trigger and Permission Preservation
```yaml
# All workflow-level constructs preserved exactly
on:
  push: # All existing trigger conditions unchanged
  pull_request: # All existing trigger conditions unchanged
  workflow_dispatch: # All existing trigger conditions unchanged

permissions: # All OIDC token permissions preserved exactly
  contents: read
  actions: read
  security-events: write
```

# Feature Specification Template

**Purpose:** This template provides a standardized structure for creating feature specification documents that capture specific functionality requirements, implementation details, and integration patterns within an epic context.

**Target Audience:** Development teams and AI assistants implementing specific features as part of larger epic initiatives.

**How to Use:**
1. Replace placeholders like `[Feature Name]`, `[Epic Number]`, `[YYYY-MM-DD]` with specific details
2. Fill out each section based on feature requirements and implementation approach
3. Embed relevant Mermaid diagrams in Section 2 following DiagrammingStandards.md
4. Maintain relative links to epic specifications and component dependencies
5. Update as feature implementation progresses and technical details evolve

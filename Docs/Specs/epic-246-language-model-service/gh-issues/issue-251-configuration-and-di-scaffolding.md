## 1. Overall Goal / User Story Context

Provide configuration types and DI wiring for LMS v2, matching the spec. Include service-level performance options and per-provider concurrency.

## 2. Requirements (Mandatory Expectations)

- Implement `LanguageModelServiceConfig` with `Performance`
- Implement `ProviderConfigBase` with `MaxConcurrentRequests`
- Add DI extension registering ILanguageModelService, router, adapter factory, normalizer
- Register only OpenAI (SDK) and Venice (REST) adapters

## 3. Specific Task Objective

Bind config from `appsettings.json`, validate presence of default provider and provider entries, and provide DI extension `AddLanguageModelService`.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Config binds from sample appsettings in local environment
- [ ] DI resolves core services and both adapters (when configured)
- [ ] Minimal smoke test validates resolution and basic call path

## 5. Affected Components

- `Code/Zarichney.Server/Config/*`
- `Code/Zarichney.Server/Services/AI/*`
- `Code/Zarichney.Server.Tests/Services/AI/*`
- `Docs/Specs/epic-246-language-model-service/05-configuration-management.md`

## 1. Overall Goal / User Story Context

Implement Venice adapter using the generic OpenAI-compatible REST client, including tool mapping and unified response normalization.

## 2. Requirements (Mandatory Expectations)

- Map tools/roles and usage/finish reasons
- Implement error mapping for common HTTP cases (429/401/5xx)

## 3. Specific Task Objective

Create adapter and tests (unit + integration smoke with `VENICE_API_KEY`).

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Adapter compiles; unit tests cover mapping and failure modes
- [ ] Integration smoke passes with Venice key
- [ ] Logging includes provider metadata and correlation ids

## 5. Affected Components

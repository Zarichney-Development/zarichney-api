## 1. Overall Goal / User Story Context

Allow Venice adapter to select models based on request complexity and config preferences, enabling basic cost optimization.

## 2. Requirements (Mandatory Expectations)

- Use configured preferences and simple heuristics (message length, tool use)
- Allow explicit model override via `CompletionOptions.Model`

## 3. Specific Task Objective

Implement selection logic and unit tests; document behaviors in adapter.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Model selection logic implemented per config/heuristics
- [ ] Unit tests cover common paths and overrides

## 5. Affected Components

- `Code/Zarichney.Server/Services/AI/Providers/Venice/*`
- `Code/Zarichney.Server.Tests/Services/AI/Providers/Venice/*`
- `Docs/Specs/epic-246-language-model-service/05-configuration-management.md`

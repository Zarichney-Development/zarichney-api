## 1. Overall Goal / User Story Context

Introduce centralized retry/backoff policies honoring Retry-After with jitter to improve resilience across providers.

## 2. Requirements (Mandatory Expectations)

- Configurable max retries, base/max delay, backoff strategy
- Honor Retry-After header when present (bounded by config)

## 3. Specific Task Objective

Implement policy helpers and wire into provider execution paths; add unit tests for schedules.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Retry policy composes with provider calls
- [ ] Unit tests cover exponential + jitter behavior
- [ ] Retry-After honored within configured max wait

## 5. Affected Components

- `Code/Zarichney.Server/Services/AI/Resilience/*`
- `Code/Zarichney.Server.Tests/Services/AI/Resilience/*`
- `Docs/Specs/epic-246-language-model-service/05-configuration-management.md`

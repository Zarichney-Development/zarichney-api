## 1. Overall Goal / User Story Context

Remove reliance on OpenAI Assistants API in favor of Chat Completions/Responses to align with v1.5 SDK and v2 architecture.

Official migration guide: https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/migration

## 2. Requirements (Mandatory Expectations)

- Identify and replace all Assistants API code paths
- Ensure conversation/session handling remains correct under v2
- Update docs/comments and any tests referencing Assistants
 - For interim smoke tests, explicitly use a GPT‑4 family model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`) until Assistants paths are fully removed (the GPT‑5 default will fail Assistants calls)

## 3. Specific Task Objective

Perform a focused refactor to remove Assistant usage and standardize on Chat Completions/Responses, leveraging OpenAIProviderAdapter.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No references to Assistants API remain in code/tests
- [ ] All affected tests updated and passing
- [ ] Documentation references updated
 - [ ] Interim smoke tests pass with explicit GPT‑4 model, then pass with configured default after migration

## 5. Affected Components

- `Code/Zarichney.Server/*`
- `Code/Zarichney.Server.Tests/*`
- `Docs/Specs/epic-246-language-model-service/03-migration-strategy.md`

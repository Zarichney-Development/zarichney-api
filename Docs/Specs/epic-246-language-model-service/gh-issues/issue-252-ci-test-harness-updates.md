## 1. Overall Goal / User Story Context

Prepare CI to run unit tests always and integration tests with secrets for OpenAI/Venice.

## 2. Requirements (Mandatory Expectations)

- Update GitHub Actions to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `VENICE_API_KEY`
- Ensure integration tests are categorized and can be skipped locally
- Upload coverage from unit tests; do not run live provider tests on every PR by default

## 3. Specific Task Objective

Adjust workflows per testing-strategy.md, ensure parallel safety, and document how to run integration tests locally.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CI pipeline updated and passing
- [ ] Unit tests run on PR; integration tests gated by secrets
- [ ] README note for running integration locally with env vars

## 5. Affected Components

- `.github/workflows/*`
- `Code/Zarichney.Server.Tests/*`
- `Docs/Specs/epic-246-language-model-service/04-testing-strategy.md`

## 6. Relevant Background / Links

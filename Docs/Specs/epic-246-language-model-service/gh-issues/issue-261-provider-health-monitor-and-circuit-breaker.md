## 1. Overall Goal / User Story Context

Track provider health with cached status and a circuit breaker (closed/open/half-open) to avoid routing to unhealthy providers.

## 2. Requirements (Mandatory Expectations)

- Configurable thresholds for failure/success and recovery timeout
- Cached health status with periodic checks
- Integrate with router for exclusion and fallback

## 3. Specific Task Objective

Implement health monitor service; add unit tests simulating failure bursts and recovery.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Circuit transitions work per spec
- [ ] Unhealthy providers excluded from selection
- [ ] Unit tests cover failure/recovery patterns

## 5. Affected Components

- `Code/Zarichney.Server/Services/AI/Health/*`
- `Code/Zarichney.Server.Tests/Services/AI/Health/*`
- `Docs/Specs/epic-246-language-model-service/components/configuration-router.md`

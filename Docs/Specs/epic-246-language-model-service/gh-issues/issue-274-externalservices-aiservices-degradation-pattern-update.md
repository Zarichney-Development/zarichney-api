## 1. Overall Goal / User Story Context

Update service degradation checks to use `ExternalServices.AIServices` (passes if at least one provider is healthy) while retaining `ExternalServices.OpenAiApi` for endpoints that explicitly require OpenAI.

## 2. Requirements (Mandatory Expectations)

- Implement AIServices degradation logic using provider health
- Keep OpenAiApi check for explicit endpoints

## 3. Specific Task Objective

Add new check, update references, and document usage.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AIServices degradation check available and integrated
- [ ] Docs updated for endpoint maintainers

## 5. Affected Components

- `Code/Zarichney.Server/Controllers/*`
- `Code/Zarichney.Server/Services/AI/Health/*`
- `Docs/Specs/epic-246-language-model-service/README.md`

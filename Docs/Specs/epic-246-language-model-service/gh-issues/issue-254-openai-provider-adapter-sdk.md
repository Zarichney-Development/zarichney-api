## 1. Overall Goal / User Story Context

Implement OpenAI adapter using SDK v1.5 Chat Completions/Responses, including tool/function calling and response normalization to unified types.

## 2. Requirements (Mandatory Expectations)

- Use `SdkProviderAdapterBase`
- Support tools/functions (strict where configured)
- Map usage, finish reasons, and metadata to unified response
- Implement error mapping (rate limits, auth, timeouts)

## 3. Specific Task Objective

Create adapter, validators, and tests (unit + integration smoke) â€” no assistants API usage remains.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Adapter compiles and passes unit tests (mapping, errors)
- [ ] Integration smoke test passes with `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- [ ] No Assistants API references remain

## 5. Affected Components

# Legacy Workflows Archive

**Archive Date:** 2025-10-28
**Archival Reason:** Superseded by AI orchestration model
**Historical Significance:** Documents evolution from manual to AI-orchestrated development

## Purpose

This archive preserves the legacy workflow documentation that guided manual development processes before the transition to the AI orchestration model. While superseded operationally, these documents provide valuable historical context for understanding the project's development evolution.

## Archived Documents

### Architectural Foundation

**CodebaseManagerEvolution.md**
- **Significance:** ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATION - Documents executorâ†’orchestrator transformation
- **Current Relevance:** Essential context for understanding 12-agent architecture rationale
- **Status:** Preserved for continued reference with updated paths in active documentation

### Legacy Operational Workflows (Superseded)

**StandardWorkflow.md**
- **Original Purpose:** 12-step standard development process
- **Superseded By:** AgentOrchestrationGuide.md, CLAUDE.md Section 3
- **Historical Value:** Shows evolution of git workflows and quality gates

**ComplexTaskWorkflow.md**
- **Original Purpose:** 15-step TDD/Plan-First methodology
- **Superseded By:** BugInvestigator and ArchitecturalAnalyst agent coordination
- **Historical Value:** Documents design-first approach integrated into specialist agents

**TestCoverageWorkflow.md**
- **Original Purpose:** 10-step coverage enhancement process
- **Superseded By:** TestEngineer agent, /test-report and /coverage-report commands
- **Historical Value:** Foundation for current coverage excellence automation

**CodingPlannerAssistant.md**
- **Original Purpose:** AI planning assistant for development tasks
- **Superseded By:** Core Issue First Protocol, ArchitecturalAnalyst agent
- **Historical Value:** Early AI-assisted development approach

**GitHubLabelMigrationGuide.md**

- **Superseded By:** GitHubLabelStandards.md (current authority)
- **Historical Value:** Documents label system evolution

## Evolution Rationale

The transition from manual workflows to AI orchestration provided:
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** All development aspects handled systematically
- **Quality Consistency:** Standardized application of project requirements
- **Efficiency Gains:** Parallel processing and specialized expertise
- **Knowledge Preservation:** Complete context maintenance across activities

For current development guidance, see:
- **CLAUDE.md:** Strategic codebase manager operating guide
- **AgentOrchestrationGuide.md:** Comprehensive multi-agent coordination
- **CONTRIBUTING.md:** Primary contributor onboarding (includes historical context)

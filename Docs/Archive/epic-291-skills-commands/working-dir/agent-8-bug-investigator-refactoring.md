## Key Insights & Discoveries

### Insight 1: Upper-Middle Range Achievement for Advisory Agents
**Discovery:** BugInvestigator (advisory agent) achieved 52.3% reduction, matching CodeChanger's upper-middle range and significantly exceeding TestEngineer's 43.1% middle range.

**Implication:** Advisory agents with extensive documentation grounding frameworks can achieve upper-middle range reductions (50-55%) through aggressive skill extraction. Documentation grounding extraction (~150 lines) is the primary driver for advisory agents exceeding middle range targets.

### Insight 2: Documentation Grounding Largest Single Extraction
**Discovery:** Documentation grounding section (Lines 299-448, ~150 lines) was the largest single extraction in BugInvestigator, representing 63.8% of total lines saved (150 of 235 lines).

**Implication:** Advisory agents with domain-specific documentation grounding frameworks (bug domain navigation maps, system architecture understanding, known pattern recognition) benefit most from skill extraction. This validates documentation-grounding as the highest-value skill for advisory agents.

### Insight 3: Issue #297 Exceeds Original Projections
**Discovery:** Issue #297 achieved 782 lines saved (56.3% avg) vs. original realistic target of ~600-680 lines (40-50% avg).

**Implication:** Medium-impact agents had more streamlinable content than initially assessed. SecurityAuditor's exceptional 64.7% and BugInvestigator/CodeChanger's upper-middle 52% achievements demonstrate that middle-impact agents can match or exceed high-impact agent performance when extensive verbose frameworks exist.

### Insight 4: Core Issue Focus Skill Universal Applicability
**Discovery:** BugInvestigator is the third agent to extract core-issue-focus skill (after TestEngineer and CodeChanger, joined by SecurityAuditor), validating its applicability across primary agents, specialists, and advisory agents.

**Implication:** Core-issue-focus skill should be evaluated for all remaining agents with disciplined workflows (ComplianceOfficer, ArchitecturalAnalyst likely candidates).

### Insight 5: Grand Total Exceeds 2,000 Lines Milestone
**Discovery:** Combined Issues #298 + #297 achieved 2,043 lines saved across 8 agents (50.5% average reduction).

**Implication:** Epic #291 is on track to exceed 2,500+ lines saved across all 11 agents. The validated 40-70% reduction range holds strong, with exceptional upper-bound achievements (DocumentationMaintainer 68.9%, SecurityAuditor 64.7%) demonstrating the potential for agents with extensive verbose frameworks.

## Challenges & Decisions

### Challenge 1: Balancing Streamlining with Diagnostic Identity
**Issue:** BugInvestigator has extensive investigation frameworks and output format templates critical to team coordination.

**Decision:** Preserved complete 5-Phase Investigation Protocol (condensed to 11 lines) and full Output Format template (62 lines unchanged). Investigation identity remains intact while aggressive skill extraction achieved upper-middle range reduction.

### Challenge 2: Documentation Grounding Extraction Scope
**Issue:** Documentation grounding section (150 lines) included bug-specific navigation maps, known pattern recognition, and diagnostic context integration not directly generalizable to universal skill.

**Decision:** Extracted entire documentation grounding section to skill reference with "Diagnostic Grounding Priorities" subsection (7 lines including common bug patterns). Focus on diagnostic-specific grounding workflow while leveraging universal documentation loading framework.

### Challenge 3: Intent Recognition Framework Relevance
**Issue:** Intent Recognition & Flexible Authority section (45 lines) included extensive frameworks primarily relevant to specialists with dual-mode authority (analysis vs. implementation).

**Decision:** Condensed Intent Recognition to 7-line "Diagnostic Authority & Boundaries" section focused on advisory specialist identity. BugInvestigator is primarily advisory with minimal documentation authority compared to specialists like SecurityAuditor.

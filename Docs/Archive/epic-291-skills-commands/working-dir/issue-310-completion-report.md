## AGENT-SPECIFIC PATTERNS DOCUMENTED

### 1. TestEngineer ✅
**Pattern:** Add tests for uncovered methods/scenarios in target component only
**Scope Creep Risk:** Refactoring test infrastructure, standardizing patterns across codebase
**Example:** UserService.GetUserById missing coverage → Add GetUserById tests only

### 2. PromptEngineer ✅
**Pattern:** Modify specific prompt sections addressing identified issue only
**Scope Creep Risk:** Complete prompt rewrite, standardizing all placeholders
**Example:** DebtSentinel missing context ingestion → Add ingestion section only

### 3. CodeChanger ✅
**Pattern:** Minimum viable implementation satisfying user need
**Scope Creep Risk:** Feature enhancements, related features, performance optimizations
**Example:** Ingredient filter feature → Simple filter only, defer advanced combinations

### 4. BackendSpecialist ✅
**Pattern:** Resolve specific API problem with minimal changes
**Scope Creep Risk:** Service layer refactoring, async/await migration, architecture redesign
**Example:** UserService.GetUserById 500 error → Null check only, defer async refactoring

### 5. FrontendSpecialist ✅
**Pattern:** Resolve component bug with minimal UI changes
**Scope Creep Risk:** Component redesign, state management refactoring, UI/UX overhaul
**Example:** Recipe card serving size bug → Fix calculation only, defer UI redesign

### 6. WorkflowEngineer ✅
**Pattern:** Resolve specific workflow problem with minimal changes
**Scope Creep Risk:** Complete pipeline redesign, workflow consolidation
**Example:** Coverage report generation failure → Fix report step only, defer pipeline optimization

## LESSONS LEARNED

### Skill Creation Success Factors ✅

1. **Comprehensive Context Loading:**
   - Reviewing working-directory-coordination skill (Issue #311) provided proven patterns
   - Official skills structure specification ensured compliance
   - CLAUDE.md protocols provided integration requirements

2. **Progressive Resource Organization:**
   - Templates provide ready-to-use formats (copy-paste convenience)
   - Examples demonstrate realistic scenarios with complete workflows
   - Documentation provides deep-dive guidance when needed

3. **Agent-Specific Pattern Documentation:**
   - Condensed patterns (3-4 lines each) maintain SKILL.md brevity
   - Examples provide comprehensive demonstrations (~3,600-4,100 lines each)
   - Balance between main skill conciseness and resource depth

4. **Mission Drift Pattern Catalog:**
   - 6 common triggers cover majority of scope creep scenarios
   - Warning signs provide objective drift detection
   - Recovery protocols enable course correction

### Recommendations for Future Skills ✅

1. **Follow Progressive Disclosure:**
   - Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines (main workflow only)
   - Push detailed guidance to resource files
   - Balance between too brief (unclear) and too verbose (context bloat)

2. **Provide Realistic Examples:**
   - Demonstrate full workflow from start to finish
   - Include mission drift instances agents will face
   - Show both temptations and disciplined deferral

3. **Document Agent-Specific Patterns:**
   - Different agents face different scope creep risks
   - Tailor guidance to each agent's typical work
   - Provide domain-specific examples

4. **Integrate with Existing Protocols:**
   - Skills should enhance, not replace, CLAUDE.md patterns
   - Reference context package fields for alignment
   - Enable Claude's enforcement through standardized reporting

## Validated Pattern Application

### From Issues #298 + #297 Learnings

**Lower Bound Pattern (40-45%):** Agents with substantial domain-specific architecture
- FrontendSpecialist: 40.5%
- WorkflowEngineer: 41.6%
- Apply to: All 3 remaining agents as conservative baseline

**Middle Range (43-48%):** Advisory/specialist agents with moderate streamlinable content
- BackendSpecialist: 43.2%
- TestEngineer: 43.1%
- Expected for: ArchitecturalAnalyst, PromptEngineer, ComplianceOfficer

**Upper-Middle Pattern (52-53%):** Agents with extensive streamlinable coordination frameworks
- CodeChanger: 52.0%
- BugInvestigator: 52.3%
- Potential upside if verbose frameworks discovered

**Universal Skill Extraction:**
- working-directory-coordination (~60 lines per agent)
- documentation-grounding (~100-120 lines per agent)
- core-issue-focus (if mission discipline applicable)

**Streamlining Opportunities:**
- Verbose coordination frameworks ‚Üí Concise essential-only sections
- Multi-section guidelines ‚Üí Single focused paragraphs
- Redundant patterns ‚Üí Merged coordination sections
- Intent recognition frameworks ‚Üí Streamlined authority patterns

## Implementation Strategy

### Delegation Protocol
**CORE ISSUE:** Eliminate redundant cross-cutting patterns from final 3 agent definitions while preserving agent effectiveness through skill references.

**INTENT RECOGNITION:** Implementation request - PromptEngineer has direct authority over `.claude/agents/*.md` files.

**SCOPE BOUNDARY:** Modification of 3 agent definition files using validated skill extraction patterns from Issues #298 and #297.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- 43-48% context reduction per agent (validated conservative baseline)
- Agent effectiveness preserved (validated through test engagements)
- Skill references clear with 2-3 line summaries
- Progressive loading functional
- Cumulative: ~504-560 lines saved (11 agents total: 2,547-2,603 lines)

**FLEXIBLE AUTHORITY:** PromptEngineer owns `.claude/` directory with direct edit rights.

- ‚úÖ Skill references clear with 2-3 line summaries
- ‚úÖ Orchestration integration validated
- ‚úÖ Progressive loading works correctly
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds with zero warnings
- ‚úÖ Conventional commit with issue reference

### Issue #296 Completion Quality Gates
**After all 3 agents refactored:**
- ‚úÖ Cumulative savings: ~504-560 lines (Issue #296)

---

## Coordination Notes

### Working Directory Communication Protocol
All PromptEngineer engagements will follow mandatory artifact reporting:

```
üóÇÔ∏è WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED:
- Filename: [exact-filename-with-extension]
- Purpose: [brief description]
- Context for Team: [integration notes]
- Next Actions: [follow-up coordination]
```

### Artifact Discovery Mandate
Before each agent engagement, PromptEngineer must:
- Review Issues #298 and #297 completion reports and validated patterns
- Identify relevant context from 8 completed agent refactorings
- Report discovered patterns
- Apply validated techniques to remaining 3 agents

---

## Branch Strategy

**Epic Branch:** `epic/skills-commands-291` (created from main)
**Section Branch:** `section/iteration-4` (continuing from Issues #298 and #297)
**Current Branch:** `section/iteration-4` ‚úÖ

### Commit Strategy
- One commit per agent refactored
- Conventional commit messages: `feat: refactor [AgentName] with skill references (#296)`
- All commits on section/iteration-4 branch (same as Issues #298 and #297)
- Section PR created after ALL Iteration 4 issues complete

3. **Skill loading failures** ‚Üí Use validated progressive loading patterns
4. **Context reduction falls short** ‚Üí Apply realistic 43-48% baseline (conservative)

### Mitigation Strategy
- Incremental agent-by-agent approach (proven successful)
- Validation after each completion (working pattern)
- Test engagement before committing (quality gate)
- Apply Issues #298 + #297 patterns (40-70% validated range)

## Next Actions

**Immediate:**
1. ‚úÖ Create working directory and execution plan (COMPLETE)
2. üîÑ Engage PromptEngineer for ArchitecturalAnalyst refactoring (NEXT)

**Upon Issue #296 Completion:**
- Document cumulative savings (Issues #298 + #297 + #296)
- Update working directory with progress
- Coordinate handoff to Issue #295 (Validation & Testing)

**Upon Iteration 4 Completion:**
- Invoke ComplianceOfficer for section-level validation

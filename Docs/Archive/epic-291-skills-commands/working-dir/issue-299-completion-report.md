## 📊 TEMPLATE ANALYSIS

### SkillTemplate.md Structure (314 lines)
**Required Sections (11 total):**
1. ✅ YAML frontmatter (name, description)
2. ✅ Purpose & Core Mission
3. ✅ When to Use (with use cases and trigger scenarios)
4. ✅ Workflow Steps (structured with sub-steps, checklists, resources)
5. ✅ Target Agents (primary, secondary, coordination patterns)
6. ✅ Resources (templates, examples, documentation with locations and usage)
7. ✅ Integration with Team Workflows (multi-agent coordination, Claude orchestration, quality gates)
8. ✅ Success Metrics

10. ✅ Skill Status tracking section
11. ✅ Template Usage Notes (comprehensive creation guide)

**Progressive Loading Support:**
- YAML frontmatter optimization (~100 tokens target)
- SKILL.md body recommendation: under 500 lines, target 2,000-5,000 tokens
- Resources organization: one level deep from SKILL.md for immediate access
- Clear separation: metadata → instructions → resources

**Resource Organization Guidance:**
- `resources/templates/`: Reusable formats with clear placeholder syntax
- `resources/examples/`: Realistic scenarios showing complete workflows
- `resources/documentation/`: Deep dives with table of contents for files >100 lines
- `resources/scripts/`: Executable utilities solving error-prone operations

### CommandTemplate.md Structure (622 lines)
**Required Sections (16 total):**
1. ✅ YAML frontmatter (description, argument-hint, category, requires-skills)
2. ✅ Purpose & Core Capabilities
3. ✅ Usage with basic examples
4. ✅ Required Arguments (with type, description, constraints, examples)
5. ✅ Optional Arguments (with defaults and examples)
6. ✅ Boolean Flags
7. ✅ Named Parameters
8. ✅ What This Command Does (phased breakdown)
9. ✅ Output (format variations: markdown, json, summary, console)
10. ✅ Detailed Examples (3+ scenarios with explanations)
11. ✅ Error Handling & Validation (common errors with resolution steps)
12. ✅ Skill Delegation (primary skills, supporting skills, coordination)
13. ✅ Integration (agent engagement, workflow integration, quality gates, CI/CD)
14. ✅ Technical Implementation (dependencies, system requirements, configuration, performance)
15. ✅ Quality Gates (pre-execution, during execution, post-execution validation)
16. ✅ Troubleshooting (common issues, debug mode, getting help)
17. ✅ Template Usage Notes (comprehensive creation guide)

**Thin Wrapper Philosophy:**
- Commands handle: CLI interface, argument parsing, output formatting
- Skills contain: Business logic and implementation details
- Clear delegation pattern documented
- Command-skill boundary clarity table provided

**User Experience Design:**
- Progressive disclosure examples
- Helpful defaults documented
- Actionable errors with resolution steps
- Safety-first design patterns (dry-run defaults)
- Consistent argument patterns across all commands
- Context-aware feedback and next steps

## Validated Pattern Application

### From Issue #298 Learnings

**Lower Bound Pattern (40-45%):** Agents with substantial domain-specific architecture
- Apply to: CodeChanger (primary file-editing with extensive integration patterns)
- Apply to: BugInvestigator (diagnostic specialist with systematic analysis frameworks)

**Middle Range (42-48%):** Primary agents with disciplined workflows
- Apply to: SecurityAuditor (security analysis with flexible authority framework)

**Universal Skill Extraction:**
- working-directory-coordination (~60 lines per agent)
- documentation-grounding (~100-120 lines per agent)
- core-issue-focus (if mission discipline applicable)

**Streamlining Opportunities:**
- Verbose coordination frameworks ‚Üí Concise essential-only sections
- Multi-section guidelines ‚Üí Single focused paragraphs
- Redundant patterns ‚Üí Merged coordination sections

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Delegation Protocol
**CORE ISSUE:** Eliminate redundant cross-cutting patterns from 3 medium-impact agent definitions while preserving agent effectiveness through skill references.

**INTENT RECOGNITION:** Implementation request - PromptEngineer has direct authority over `.claude/agents/*.md` files.

**SCOPE BOUNDARY:** Modification of 3 agent definition files using validated skill extraction patterns from Issue #298.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- 40-50% context reduction per agent (validated baseline)
- Agent effectiveness preserved (validated through test engagements)
- Skill references clear with 2-3 line summaries
- Progressive loading functional
- Cumulative: ~600-680 lines saved (8 agents total: 1,861-1,941 lines)

**FLEXIBLE AUTHORITY:** PromptEngineer owns `.claude/` directory with direct edit rights.

- **Mission:** Security analysis, vulnerability assessment, threat mitigation
- **Integration:** Reviews implementations from all agents, coordinates with BackendSpecialist
- **Authority:** Advisory mode (working directory analysis) + Implementation mode (vulnerability fixes)

**Skills to Reference:**
- working-directory-coordination (security analysis artifact sharing)
- documentation-grounding (security standards and patterns loading)
- flexible-authority-management (if this becomes a universal specialist pattern)

**Preservation Requirements:**
- Intent recognition framework (query vs. command intent)
- Security domain expertise (OWASP, authentication, vulnerability patterns)
- Flexible authority boundaries (analysis vs. implementation modes)
- Cross-agent security coordination

**Expected Pattern:** Middle range (42-48%) due to specialist with flexible authority framework

---

### Agent 8: BugInvestigator
**Owner:** PromptEngineer
**Current:** 449 lines
**Realistic Target:** 225-245 lines (44-48% reduction, ~204-224 lines saved)

**Agent Profile:**
- **Type:** SPECIALIST (advisory/diagnostic focus)
- **Mission:** Root cause analysis, diagnostic reporting, systematic debugging
- **Integration:** Receives bug reports, provides diagnostic analysis via working directory
- **Authority:** Advisory only (working directory artifacts, no direct file modification)

**Skills to Reference:**
- working-directory-coordination (diagnostic artifact generation and reporting)
- documentation-grounding (systematic context loading for analysis)

**Preservation Requirements:**
- Diagnostic analysis frameworks and systematic debugging workflows
- Root cause investigation patterns
- Performance analysis and stack trace interpretation
- Working directory artifact generation expertise

**Expected Pattern:** Middle range (44-48%) due to advisory agent with systematic analysis frameworks

## Coordination Notes

### Working Directory Communication Protocol
All PromptEngineer engagements will follow mandatory artifact reporting:

```
üóÇÔ∏è WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED:
- Filename: [exact-filename-with-extension]
- Purpose: [brief description]
- Context for Team: [integration notes]
- Next Actions: [follow-up coordination]
```

### Artifact Discovery Mandate
Before each agent engagement, PromptEngineer must:
- Review Issue #298 completion report and validated patterns
- Identify relevant context from 5 high-impact agent refactorings
- Report discovered patterns
- Apply validated techniques to medium-impact agents

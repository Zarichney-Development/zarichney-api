4. **Implementation Authority:** General code modification vs exclusive testing authority

### Pattern Validation
- ✅ **Primary agents achieve 40-70% reduction range** (CodeChanger 52.0%, TestEngineer 43.1%)
- ✅ **Extensive verbose coordination frameworks enable higher reductions** (similar to DocumentationMaintainer's 68.9%)

## Key Insights & Discoveries

### Insight 1: Upper-Middle Range Achievement for Primary Agents
**Discovery:** CodeChanger (primary agent) achieved 52.0% reduction, significantly exceeding TestEngineer's 43.1% middle range.

**Implication:** Primary agents with extensive verbose coordination frameworks can achieve reductions in the 50-60% range, approaching DocumentationMaintainer's 68.9% upper bound. This validates that streamlinable content volume is a stronger predictor than agent type (primary vs specialist).

### Insight 2: Intent Recognition Frameworks Highly Streamlinable
**Discovery:** Intent Recognition & Specialist Coordination section reduced from 104 lines to 16 lines (84.6% reduction) while preserving all essential patterns.

**Implication:** Extensive YAML frameworks and verbose explanatory paragraphs are prime candidates for aggressive condensation. Focused bullet lists and concise descriptions maintain functionality with 80-90% space savings.

### Insight 3: Technical Standards Consolidation Effectiveness
**Discovery:** Technical Implementation Standards sections reduced from 58 lines to 9 lines (84.5% reduction) while preserving all essential compliance patterns.

**Implication:** Multiple related sections can be merged into focused paragraphs. Condensed parenthetical descriptions maintain comprehensive coverage while eliminating verbose explanatory content.

### Insight 4: Core Issue Focus Skill Valuable for All Primary Agents
**Discovery:** CodeChanger is the second primary agent to extract core-issue-focus skill (after TestEngineer), validating its applicability to disciplined implementation workflows.

**Implication:** Core-issue-focus skill should be evaluated for remaining primary agents (DocumentationMaintainer already completed at 68.9% without it, but ComplianceOfficer and PromptEngineer may benefit).

## Challenges & Decisions

### Challenge 1: Balancing Streamlining with Implementation Identity
**Issue:** CodeChanger has extensive implementation coordination patterns critical to team integration.

**Decision:** Preserved all implementation authority boundaries and specialist coordination patterns while aggressively streamlining verbose explanatory frameworks. Implementation identity remains intact with condensed workflow patterns.

### Challenge 2: Intent Recognition Framework Extraction vs Streamlining
**Issue:** Intent Recognition & Specialist Coordination section (104 lines) included extensive YAML frameworks not directly generalizable to skill.

**Decision:** Streamlined Intent Recognition section to 16 lines preserving all specialist handoff patterns, rather than creating new skill. Focus on implementation-specific patterns that define CodeChanger's coordination role.

### Challenge 3: Technical Standards Consolidation
**Issue:** Multiple technical standards sections (Technical Guidelines, Code Quality, Boundaries) totaling 58 lines.

**Decision:** Merged all technical standards into focused paragraphs (9 lines) using parenthetical descriptions and condensed lists. Preserved complete technical coverage while eliminating verbose explanations already covered in documentation-grounding skill.

## Key Insights & Discoveries

### Insight 1: Primary vs. Specialist Reduction Consistency
**Discovery:** TestEngineer (primary agent) achieved 43.1% reduction, nearly identical to BackendSpecialist (43.2%) and FrontendSpecialist (40.5%).

**Implication:** The 40-50% reduction pattern applies to BOTH primary and specialist agents, not just dual-mode specialists. This validates the baseline for all high-impact agents regardless of implementation authority framework.

### Insight 2: Core Issue Focus Skill Highly Valuable for Primary Agents
**Discovery:** TestEngineer is the first agent to extract core-issue-focus skill, which proved highly relevant to testing discipline and mission focus.

**Implication:** Core-issue-focus skill should be evaluated for extraction in remaining primary agents (ComplianceOfficer, DocumentationMaintainer). This skill is particularly valuable for agents with disciplined workflows requiring scope management.

### Insight 3: Streamlining Effectiveness Across Agent Types
**Discovery:** TestEngineer achieved significant line savings through aggressive streamlining (40+ lines from testing requirements, 32 from methodology, 26 from organization).

**Implication:** Verbose sections with detailed bullet points are prime candidates for condensation across all agents. Consolidated statements preserving essential content can reduce line count by 60-80% without functionality loss.

### Insight 4: Testing-Specific Coordination Preserved
**Discovery:** Despite aggressive streamlining, all testing excellence patterns remained intact (coverage progression, epic integration, quality gates).

**Implication:** Domain-specific expertise can coexist with aggressive streamlining when essential patterns are preserved in condensed form.

## Challenges & Decisions

### Challenge 1: Balancing Streamlining with Testing Excellence Identity
**Issue:** TestEngineer has extensive testing excellence progression sections critical to coverage initiative coordination.

**Decision:** Preserved all testing excellence sections (30 lines for coverage coordination, epic integration, phase strategy) while aggressively streamlining verbose workflow descriptions. Testing excellence identity remains intact with condensed workflow patterns.

### Challenge 2: Core Issue Focus Skill Extraction
**Issue:** TestEngineer's core issue focus section included testing-specific patterns (brittle tests policy, production refactor coordination) not directly generalizable.

**Decision:** Extracted general mission discipline to core-issue-focus skill, added 8-line "Testing-Specific Application" subsection highlighting key testing applications (test-first pattern, production refactor coordination, zero-tolerance brittle tests, framework improvements scope).

### Challenge 3: Specialist Implementation Awareness Preservation
**Issue:** TestEngineer has extensive specialist implementation awareness sections (63 lines) describing coordination with all specialists.

**Decision:** Preserved complete specialist implementation awareness framework as essential to TestEngineer's team integration identity. This section cannot be extracted without losing testing coordination context for specialist implementations.

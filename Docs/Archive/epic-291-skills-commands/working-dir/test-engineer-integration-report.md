3. Create unit/integration tests
4. Run test suite and validate coverage
5. Report completion to Claude

**Enhanced Workflow with working-directory-coordination:**
1. **Pre-Work Discovery:** Check working directory for existing coverage analysis, testing strategies, or design artifacts
2. Receive testing requirements from Claude (with fresh context package including discovered artifacts)
3. Analyze code requiring test coverage (building upon prior analysis if found)
4. **Context-Aware Planning:** Prioritize test creation based on design artifacts and coverage gaps
5. Create unit/integration tests
6. Run test suite and validate coverage
7. **Immediate Reporting:** Report test artifacts immediately for team awareness
8. **Integration Documentation:** Document how tests align with design decisions and coverage strategies

**Assessment:** ‚úÖ **SEAMLESS INTEGRATION**
- Skill enhances rather than disrupts existing workflow
- Discovery step naturally fits pre-work phase

#### Epic #291 Remaining Skills Assessment

**Remaining 7 Skills (from skills-catalog.md):**
1. Issue #310 - mission-focused-testing (TestEngineer)
2. Issue #309 - epic-orchestration (Claude)
3. Issue #308 - intelligent-handoffs (Claude)
4. Issue #307 - specialized-coordination (Specialists)
5. Issue #306 - scope-discipline (All Agents)

**Pattern Applicability:**

**Coordination Skills (similar to working-directory-coordination):**
- ‚úÖ epic-orchestration: Same structure with orchestration workflow steps
- ‚úÖ intelligent-handoffs: Templates for handoff communication formats
- ‚úÖ specialized-coordination: Specialist-specific workflow guidance

**Technical Skills (slightly different focus):**
- ‚úÖ mission-focused-testing: Testing-specific workflow with test pattern templates
- ‚úÖ scope-discipline: Core issue focus workflow with scope boundary templates
- ‚úÖ fresh-context-ingestion: Context loading workflow with documentation grounding checklists

**Reference Skills (more resource-heavy):**
- ‚úÖ best-practices-reference: Potentially more examples/ and documentation/, same structure

**Replication Confidence:** ‚úÖ **HIGH CONFIDENCE - PATTERN VALIDATED FOR ALL REMAINING SKILLS**

---

#### Token Efficiency Validation for Epic Scale

**Single Skill Token Analysis:**
```
Frontmatter:        ~100 tokens
SKILL.md:         ~2,500 tokens
Templates (3):    ~1,500 tokens (on-demand)
Examples (2):     ~4,000 tokens (on-demand)
Documentation:    ~3,500 tokens (on-demand)

Upfront Cost:       ~2,600 tokens
Maximum On-Demand: ~9,000 tokens (if all resources loaded)
```

**Epic-Scale Token Projection:**
```
8 skills √ó 2,600 tokens upfront = ~20,800 tokens (if all frontmatters + instructions loaded)

Progressive Loading Benefit:
- Agent loads only relevant skill frontmatter (~100 tokens) to assess applicability
- Agent loads only chosen skill instructions (~2,500 tokens) for execution
- Agent loads only needed resources (variable, typically 0-4,000 tokens)

Realistic Agent Engagement Token Usage:
- Relevance check: ~100 tokens (1 skill frontmatter)
- Execution: ~2,500-6,500 tokens (1 skill + selected resources)
- Multiple skills: Progressive loading prevents token explosion
```

**Token Efficiency Assessment:** ‚úÖ **ARCHITECTURE SCALES EFFICIENTLY ACROSS EPIC**

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
1. SkillsDevelopmentGuide.md enables skill creation without external clarification
2. CommandsDevelopmentGuide.md enables command creation without external clarification
3. All sections complete with clear, actionable guidance
4. Examples demonstrate all skill/command types
5. Integration patterns comprehensive with agent orchestration
6. Cross-references to standards and templates functional

## Pre-Refactoring Analysis

### Current State
- **Before:** 316 lines
- **Target:** 160-180 lines (43-48% reduction)
- **Lines to Save:** ~136-156 lines
- **Agent Type:** SPECIALIST (advisory/validation focus)

### Agent Profile
- **Authority:** Advisory only (working directory artifacts, technical documentation elevation for command intents)
- **Mission:** Final pre-PR validation, comprehensive compliance check, dual validation partnership with Claude
- **Integration:** Partners with Claude for section-level validation, reviews all agent deliverables
- **Differentiation:** Pre-PR soft gate (vs. StandardsGuardian post-PR CI/CD review)

### Extraction Opportunities

#### 1. Documentation Grounding Protocol (Lines 22-53)

#### 2. Working Directory Communication Standards (Lines 54-99)
**UNIVERSAL EXTRACTION:**
- **Current:** 46 lines of standard communication protocols
- **Target:** Extract to working-directory-coordination skill with validation-specific artifacts
- **Expected Savings:** ~42 lines
- **Pattern:** All 10 agents successfully extracted this section

#### 3. Intent Recognition Framework (Lines 101-145)

- **Target:** Consolidate into concise focused validation sections (~20 lines)
- **Expected Savings:** ~32 lines
- **Pattern:** Apply aggressive checklist consolidation from SecurityAuditor

#### 5. Validation Workflow (Lines 200-268)
**STREAMLINE METHODOLOGY:**
- **Current:** 69 lines of detailed 3-phase workflow with verbose reporting template
- **Target:** Condense to essential workflow (~15-20 lines)
- **Expected Savings:** ~49-54 lines
- **Technique:** SecurityAuditor achieved 88.7% avg reduction in verbose frameworks

#### 6. Partnership with Codebase Manager (Lines 270-278)
**MAINTAIN:**
- **Current:** 9 lines - brief section describing dual validation protocol
- **Action:** Keep as-is (essential differentiation)

#### 7. Differentiation from StandardsGuardian (Lines 280-295)
**STREAMLINE COMPARISON:**
- **Current:** 16 lines distinguishing roles
- **Target:** Reduce to 5-7 lines concise differentiation
- **Expected Savings:** ~9-11 lines

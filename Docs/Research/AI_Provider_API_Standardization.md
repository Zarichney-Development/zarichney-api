# Executive Summary

Major LLM providers have converged on similar RESTful **Chat Completion APIs** modeled after OpenAI’s format, but with notable differences in endpoints, message schema, and feature support. Many vendors now offer “OpenAI-compatible” endpoints – meaning developers can reuse existing OpenAI API code by simply changing the base URL and API key[\[1\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=Since%20the%20APIs%20of%20Qwen,Max%20in%20Python)[\[2\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/#:~:text=The%20DeepSeek%20API%20uses%20an,to%20access%20the%20DeepSeek%20API). This report compares the REST APIs of OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), Venice.AI, xAI (Grok), Meta’s Llama (via partners), DeepSeek, Perplexity, and Alibaba’s Qwen. We analyze common patterns (e.g. chat messages arrays with roles, function/tool calling) and pinpoint critical differences (authentication, request/response schemas, streaming protocols, etc.). We then recommend an architecture for a **vendor-agnostic ILanguageModelService** in .NET 8 that abstracts these differences, enabling dynamic routing to multiple LLM backends without lock-in.

**Key Findings:** Most providers support role-based chat messages and parameters like model, temperature, max\_tokens, and stream, but subtle incompatibilities exist in how **function/tool use** is defined and returned, how streaming is implemented, and in provider-specific extensions. Official .NET SDKs are rare – direct HTTP calls (with HttpClient or cURL) are the primary integration method in .NET, favoring a unified REST-first approach for long-term maintenance. Some providers expose unique capabilities (e.g. OpenAI’s upcoming Assistants/Agents API, Anthropic’s “extended thinking”, Perplexity’s web-grounding, etc.) that cannot cleanly fit a common interface and may require conditional handling.

Below, we present comparison tables and deep dives for each provider’s core API design, followed by recommendations for structuring ILanguageModelService and related models (ChatMessage, ToolDefinition, etc.) to accommodate both common functionality and provider-specific quirks.

| **Alibaba Qwen** | **DashScope** endpoint (Alibaba Cloud): e.g. https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions[\[24\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=from%20openai%20import%20OpenAI%20import,os) | Bearer token (Authorization: Bearer \<API\_KEY\>) (uses Alibaba Cloud API key)[\[1\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=Since%20the%20APIs%20of%20Qwen,Max%20in%20Python) | Yes – Qwen APIs are OpenAI-API compatible[\[1\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=Since%20the%20APIs%20of%20Qwen,Max%20in%20Python) | No official .NET (use Alibaba Cloud SDKs or direct REST) |

**Notes:** *OpenAI-compatible* means the provider accepts the same JSON schema and path (/v1/chat/completions) as OpenAI. For example, Anthropic and Google allow using OpenAI’s client libraries by pointing the base URL to their API and using their key[\[25\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=1,for%20what%20features%20are%20supported)[\[6\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=client%20%3D%20OpenAI%28%20api_key%3D,). This usually covers chat completion and basic parameters, but may not support every OpenAI feature (see below). Meta’s Llama2 lacks an official API – integration is via cloud platforms or self-hosted endpoints, each with their own interface (not standardized). In general, no provider above offers an official .NET SDK as of 2025; integration in .NET is done via direct HTTP calls or community libraries. Using direct REST calls provides a consistent, maintainable approach across providers, whereas SDKs (if available in other languages) would each have different idioms and update cycles.

## Chat Completion Request & Response Schema Comparison

All providers follow the concept of sending a **conversation** as an array of messages with roles, and returning a model-generated message. However, there are subtle schema differences in roles, field names, and additional metadata. The table below highlights key fields and any notable incompatibilities:

| Aspect | OpenAI (GPT-4/3.5) | Anthropic (Claude) | Google (Gemini) | Others (Venice, xAI, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Qwen) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Messages Role Types** | system, user, assistant (plus function for function-call results)[\[26\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=The%20format%20of%20a%20basic,chat%20completion%20is)[\[27\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=System%20role). *OpenAI recently added developer (alias of system) and may deprecate function in favor of a tool role*[\[28\]](https://www.newapi.ai/en/api/openai-chat/#:~:text=instructions%20regardless%20of%20what%20message,Function%20message%20Deprecated)[\[29\]](https://www.newapi.ai/en/api/openai-chat/#:~:text=Assistant%20message%20Messages%20sent%20by,Function%20message%20Deprecated). | Supports one *initial* system message only (Claude hoists multiple system/dev messages into one)[\[30\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,a%20single%20initial%20system%20message)[\[31\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=System%20%2F%20Developer%20message%20hoisting). Uses roles: “user”, “assistant”. A “developer” role is used internally for system-like instructions[\[32\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,a%20single%20initial%20system%20message)[\[31\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=System%20%2F%20Developer%20message%20hoisting). Function-call results use a tool role in Claude’s format (Anthropic’s Model Protocol) – in OpenAI-compat mode, function results are returned as tool messages and are also accessible via a tool\_calls array in responses[\[33\]\[34\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=%60choices,Fully%20supported). | Same core roles as OpenAI (system,user,assistant). Gemini also supports multimodal content in messages (e.g. content can be an array of text and image parts)[\[35\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=,8)[\[36\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=,). Function results are treated as “tool” messages (consistent with OpenAI’s emerging usage). | **Venice:** same roles as OpenAI; also allows model-specific extensions like “assistant (with vision)” via model suffix[\[37\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Venice%20Medium%203)[\[38\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Extend%20models%20with%20built%E2%80%91in%20tools). \<br\> **xAI:** uses OpenAI roles; also supports an Anthropic-style /v1/messages endpoint for Claude-compatible role handling[\[39\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=Messages%20). \<br\> **DeepSeek:** same roles as OpenAI for user/assistant; uses tool role for function results (and requires a tool\_call\_id reference)[\[40\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=tool%20%3D%20message.tool_calls)[\[41\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=messages.append%28%7B,24%E2%84%83). \<br\> **Perplexity:** same roles as OpenAI. (System role used to set up “grounded” conversation context; user prompts trigger answers with citations.) |
| **Request JSON Fields** | **Required:** model, messages. **Optional:** temperature, top\_p, n (number of completions), max\_tokens, stop, stream, functions (for tool use), function\_call (to force or disable calling)[\[42\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=Standard%20OpenAI%20parameters)[\[43\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=These%20parameters%20work%20exactly%20the,same%20as%20OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20API). Also supports presence\_penalty, frequency\_penalty, and logit\_bias[\[42\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=Standard%20OpenAI%20parameters). | **Required:** model, messages. **Optional:** max\_tokens, temperature (0–1 range), top\_p, stream (true/false), stop. *Ignores* OpenAI-specific fields like n (Anthropic only returns 1 completion), presence\_penalty, frequency\_penalty, logprobs etc[\[44\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=Field%20Support%20status%20,than%201%20are%20capped%20at)[\[45\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,Ignored). In Claude’s native API, max\_tokens is the cap on output (formerly called max\_tokens\_to\_sample). Function calling is supported via OpenAI-compat fields (functions array); the strict flag on functions is **ignored** by Claude[\[46\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,a%20single%20initial%20system%20message)[\[47\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=%60tools,Ignored). | **Required:** model, messages. **Optional:** temperature, top\_p, max\_tokens, stop, stream. Google extends the schema with a **“thinking”** parameter (Gemini’s *reasoning budget*): the OpenAI-equivalent field is reasoning\_effort with values “low/medium/high” mapping to token budgets[\[48\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=Gemini%202,much%20the%20model%20will%20think). Also uses tool\_choice to control function calling (e.g. “auto” vs a specific function name, similar to OpenAI’s function\_call field)[\[49\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=messages%20%3D%20%5B%7B,flash%22%2C%20messages%3Dmessages%2C%20tools%3Dtools%2C%20tool_choice%3D%22auto%22)[\[50\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=messages%3Dmessages%2C%20tools%3Dtools%2C%20tool_choice%3D). | **Venice:** Same core fields as OpenAI (model, messages, etc.). Adds optional venice\_parameters for built-in tools/modes (e.g. to enable web search or vision)[\[51\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Extend%20models%20with%20built%E2%80%91in%20tools)[\[52\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Vision%20Processing). \<br\> **xAI:** Matches OpenAI fields exactly for chat completions (full OpenAI parity)[\[17\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=The%20xAI%20Enterprise%20API%20is,with%20the%20OpenAI%20REST%20API). Also offers extra endpoints (e.g. /v1/responses for stateful chats, not in OpenAI API). \<br\> **DeepSeek:** Matches OpenAI fields; supports an additional “thinking mode” by using special model IDs (deepseek-reasoner vs deepseek-chat) to enable multi-step reasoning[\[53\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/#:~:text=model%27s%20version). Ignored fields are similar to Anthropic (only one response allowed, etc.). \<br\> **Perplexity:** Matches OpenAI fields for chat[\[42\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=Standard%20OpenAI%20parameters). Adds custom fields for web search control, e.g. search\_domain\_filter, search\_recency\_filter, etc., to refine retrieved evidence[\[54\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=Perplexity). These are passed via an extra\_body in OpenAI SDK usage[\[55\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=%7B,%7D). \<br\> **Qwen:** Matches OpenAI fields (via “compatible-mode” endpoint)[\[1\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=Since%20the%20APIs%20of%20Qwen,Max%20in%20Python). Native Alibaba API (DashScope) allows advanced settings (e.g. tool use, multi-modal) via separate parameters, but those are accessible through OpenAI-compatible mode only to the extent they map to OpenAI fields. |
| **Response Structure** | JSON with an id, object: "chat.completion", created timestamp, model id, and a choices list (one per completion)[\[56\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=%7B%20%22id%22%3A%20%22chatcmpl,and%20Chief%20Software%20Architect%20until)[\[57\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=%22created%22%3A%201698892410%2C%20%22model%22%3A%20%22gpt,). Each choice has an **index**, the message (role \+ content or function\_call), and a finish\_reason[\[58\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=,company%20in%201983%20but%20remained)[\[59\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=Every%20response%20includes%20,are). Also a usage object (token counts)[\[57\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=%22created%22%3A%201698892410%2C%20%22model%22%3A%20%22gpt,). Example OpenAI response: a single choice with *assistant* role and text content[\[60\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=,assistant). If a function was called, the assistant’s message will include a function\_call object instead of content. | In Claude’s native API, the response is a single message object, not a choices array[\[61\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=Copy)[\[62\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=questions%20or%20let%20me%20know,30). (OpenAI-compat mode wraps it in a choices\[0\] for compatibility[\[63\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=Field%20Support%20status%20,Fully%20supported)[\[64\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=%60choices,Fully%20supported).) Claude’s message content is an array of segments, each with a type (e.g. "text") and text string[\[65\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=%22role%22%3A%20%22assistant%22%2C%20%22model%22%3A%20%22claude,%7D). This supports non-text content, though for text-only output it’s a single segment. The stop\_reason (“stop”/“max\_tokens”/etc.) is provided per message[\[66\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=%5D%2C%20,30%20%7D). If a function/tool is invoked, Claude’s compatibility mode includes a tool\_calls array in the assistant message[\[34\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=%60choices,Fully%20supported) – each entry has the called function name and arguments. (This is an Anthropics-specific extension; OpenAI’s format would instead show a function\_call in the message.) Usage tokens are reported similarly (prompt\_tokens, output\_tokens). | Returns OpenAI-like JSON with choices. Gemini’s compatibility ensures the output matches OpenAI’s schema exactly[\[10\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=Gemini%20models%20are%20accessible%20using,call%20the%20Gemini%20API%20directly)[\[8\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=curl%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fgenerativelanguage.googleapis.com%2Fv1beta%2Fopenai%2Fchat%2Fcompletions%22%20%5C%20,to%20me%20how%20AI%20works). (Internally, Google may attach extra data like safety metadata or *thinking steps*, but those are either not returned or are in provider-specific fields.) In OpenAI-compat mode, a function call result would appear as a message with role: "assistant" and a function\_call field (or possibly as a tool message; Google’s docs emphasize using their own SDK for full features)[\[67\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=Python)[\[68\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=Function%20calling). | **Venice:** Follows OpenAI response format (choices array). Additionally, if *Venice* built-in tools are used (e.g. web search), the model’s answer may contain tool outputs (with citations) embedded in content[\[69\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Toggle%20on%20compatible%20models%20using,or%20model%20suffixes)[\[52\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Vision%20Processing), but the JSON structure remains OpenAI-like. \<br\> **xAI:** Mirrors OpenAI’s response JSON (the xAI API explicitly supports all OpenAI fields and error formats[\[70\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=Error%20message%20compatibility)). It also offers extra metadata through separate endpoints (not in the chat completion response itself). \<br\> **DeepSeek:** Matches OpenAI format (choices array). If a tool/function is called, the assistant’s message includes a function\_call (for OpenAI SDK compatibility) *and* DeepSeek will also list it in a tool\_calls field with an id for tracking[\[71\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=print%28f)[\[40\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=tool%20%3D%20message.tool_calls). The developer must then return a tool role message with that id. \<br\> **Perplexity:** Matches OpenAI response format exactly[\[72\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=%29%20print%28resp.choices)[\[73\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=Your%20responses%20will%20match%20OpenAI%E2%80%99s,below%20for%20complete%20field%20details) (the API ensures field parity). In addition, the content of the assistant’s message will include citations (e.g. “\[1\]”) and an appended list of sources in a grounded answer. These sources are part of the message content, not separate JSON fields. \<br\> **Qwen:** Through the compatible endpoint, returns OpenAI-style responses. (Using Alibaba’s native API might return a different structure, but when compatible-mode is used, the output JSON aligns with OpenAI’s schema[\[1\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=Since%20the%20APIs%20of%20Qwen,Max%20in%20Python)[\[24\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=from%20openai%20import%20OpenAI%20import,os).) |

**Highlights:** All providers require a model name and a conversation messages list in the request. **Role handling** is mostly uniform, with *system/user/assistant* roles; some providers introduced a developer/system distinction (Anthropic hoists multiple system messages into one, and OpenAI’s newer models treat a “developer” role similarly to system[\[30\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,a%20single%20initial%20system%20message)). A few have deprecated the “function” role in favor of a more general “tool” role for model tool outputs[\[28\]](https://www.newapi.ai/en/api/openai-chat/#:~:text=instructions%20regardless%20of%20what%20message,Function%20message%20Deprecated)[\[29\]](https://www.newapi.ai/en/api/openai-chat/#:~:text=Assistant%20message%20Messages%20sent%20by,Function%20message%20Deprecated) – this is seen in Claude and emerging in OpenAI’s newer API updates.

**Parameter support:** Basic generation settings (temperature, top\_p, etc.) are widely supported. **Penalties** (frequency/presence) are accepted by OpenAI and perhaps Google, but Claude ignores them[\[45\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,Ignored). Most providers only return **one** completion per request; OpenAI’s n \> 1 is not supported by Claude or DeepSeek[\[74\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,Ignored). All support **streaming** (see below) via a stream: true flag. Providers with extended capabilities include extra parameters: e.g. Perplexity’s search filters, Google’s reasoning\_effort for “thinking” mode[\[48\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=Gemini%202,much%20the%20model%20will%20think), Venice’s venice\_parameters toggles, etc. These extra fields typically have defaults so they can be omitted for basic use.

**Response differences:** OpenAI’s response is simple (first choice’s message contains the answer text). Anthropic’s native response is more complex, splitting content into parts and using SSE events (the compatibility layer simplifies this into an OpenAI-like format). Some providers return additional metadata: e.g. Azure/OpenAI includes content filtering results per message[\[75\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=,false)[\[76\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=%7D%20%7D%20%7D%20%5D%2C%20,73), which third-party APIs usually don’t. In general, when using the compatibility endpoints, the aim is to **“match OpenAI’s format exactly”**[\[73\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=Your%20responses%20will%20match%20OpenAI%E2%80%99s,below%20for%20complete%20field%20details) – any unsupported fields are omitted or set to null, allowing clients to parse responses without errors.

## Tool Use (Function Calling) Schema Comparison

One of the more complex features to abstract is **function calling** (a.k.a tool use). OpenAI introduced a JSON-based function specification and a workflow for the model to request a function and consume its result. Other providers have adopted similar ideas, often with slight variations in naming or sequence. The table below compares how each handles tool definitions, invocation in responses, and result passing:

| Provider | Defining Tools/Functions in Request | Model’s Invocation in Response | Returning Function Results to Model |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **OpenAI** | Include a "functions" array in the request. Each function is defined by name, description, and parameters (JSON Schema for args)[\[77\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=tools%20%3D%20%5B%20%7B%20,)[\[78\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=,fahrenheit). You may also send a function\_call field (e.g. {"function\_call": "auto"} or specify a particular function name to force-call, or "none" to disable) in the request. | If the model decides to use a function, it responds with an **assistant** message containing a function\_call object (with the name and arguments JSON string) instead of normal content. The role remains "assistant" (OpenAI does *not* introduce a new role here)[\[79\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=,null). The finish\_reason will be "function\_call" to signal an intermediate step. | The client executes the function, then sends a new message with role: "function", name: *function name*, and content: *function output*. This informs the model of the tool result. The next model response (assistant role) should then be the final answer. (OpenAI may soon use role: "tool" for this purpose, but current API uses "function"). |
| **Anthropic** | *OpenAI-compat mode:* Accepts functions similar to OpenAI (any strict flag is ignored)[\[46\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,a%20single%20initial%20system%20message)[\[47\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=%60tools,Ignored). *Native Claude API:* Anthropic has a concept of “tools” defined outside of the prompt via their **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** – developers can define tools with a JSON schema. (In practice, the OpenAI-format is the easiest way to provide tool definitions to Claude’s API). | In compat mode, Claude’s response will include the tool invocation. Instead of a function\_call field, Claude returns a tool\_calls list inside the assistant message[\[34\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=%60choices,Fully%20supported). For example, message.tool\_calls\[0\] might contain { "name": "get\_weather", "arguments": "{...}" }. The assistant’s text content may be empty or a brief acknowledgement. Claude uses role "assistant" for this response (with the tool call listed separately). | The client should execute the tool and then send a message with role: "tool" (Claude expects a “tool” role message) containing the function’s result, along with a reference to which call it fulfills (e.g. an ID). **Example (Claude via DeepSeek):** model requests get\_weather({"location":"Hangzhou"}), client appends: { "role": "tool", "tool\_call\_id": \<id\>, "content": "24℃" }[\[71\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=print%28f)[\[40\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=tool%20%3D%20message.tool_calls). Claude then returns an assistant answer utilizing that result. *(Note:* In pure OpenAI-compat mode, Anthropic might alternatively accept a role:"function" message; but their documented approach favors a tool role.) |
| **Google (Gemini)** | Accepts tool definitions but uses the term "tools" in the JSON. Each tool entry has a "type": "function" and a function object with name/description/parameters (same schema format as OpenAI)[\[80\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=%22model%22%3A%20%22gemini,function)[\[81\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=,). Use the tool\_choice field to control function calling behavior (e.g. "auto" to let model decide, or set to a specific function name to force a call, analogous to OpenAI’s function\_call parameter)[\[82\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=model%3D%22gemini)[\[83\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=model%3A%20%22gemini,). | When a function is to be called, Gemini’s response (in OpenAI-compatible mode) mirrors OpenAI: an assistant message with a function\_call field. Under the hood, Google’s API has robust tool integration (including Google’s own tools like Search, Code Execution, etc.), but through the compatibility layer these appear as normal function calls. (If using Google’s native SDK, the tool call might be handled seamlessly – but via REST, you handle it as you would with OpenAI.) | The client supplies the function’s result as a subsequent message. In OpenAI format, that would be role: "function", name: \<funcName\>, content: "\<output\>". Google’s compatibility docs don’t explicitly diverge here, so we assume the standard approach. (Their native API might allow the model to continue automatically after tool use if configured, but such details are abstracted away in the OpenAI-style use.) |
| **Venice.AI** | Fully supports OpenAI-style function calling (pass functions array in request just like OpenAI). Additionally, Venice has **built-in tools** (Web search, code execution, vision processing) that can be toggled via model ID suffix or parameters[\[38\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Extend%20models%20with%20built%E2%80%91in%20tools)[\[84\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Vision%20Processing). For instance, using a model ID with “-tools” or setting "venice\_parameters": {"enable\_tools": true} might allow the model to call web search on its own. When using custom functions, the definition format is the same as OpenAI’s. | Returns function calls in OpenAI format (function\_call in assistant message) for custom functions. For built-in tools, Venice’s model might directly produce an answer with integrated results (e.g. including a cited web result) rather than explicitly asking the caller to invoke a tool. However, when it does need external data (e.g. web query), the process is abstracted – the model itself performs the search if allowed. In a pure custom function scenario, expect an assistant message with function\_call similar to OpenAI. | If using custom functions, the client should respond with a "function" role message containing the result, as usual. For Venice’s internal tools, no action is required from the client – the model handles those (e.g. the model will call the web and include the findings in its final answer). From the perspective of ILanguageModelService, you’d mostly handle custom-defined functions similarly to OpenAI. |
| **xAI (Grok)** | Uses OpenAI-compatible function definitions (the xAI API was built with OpenAI parity[\[17\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=The%20xAI%20Enterprise%20API%20is,with%20the%20OpenAI%20REST%20API)). Define functions array in the JSON request as you would for OpenAI. Grok supports function calling and also a concept called “Tools with Reasoning” (allowing the model to think in steps and use functions). | Grok returns function call requests in the same manner as OpenAI (assistant message with function\_call). The xAI docs indicate support for function calling in their models[\[85\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/overview#:~:text=Function%20calling) and even have an extended *“Chat with Reasoning”* mode where the model might output reasoning steps. But from an API response standpoint, function invocation will follow the familiar pattern (likely with function\_call object). | The client sends back a function\-role message with the result. xAI’s API should accept this and return the final assistant answer. (If using their native SDK, some of this might be streamlined, but via REST the loop is the same as OpenAI’s.) One caveat: xAI’s advanced features (like *Collections* for providing custom knowledge, or *deferred responses*) are outside the simple function-calling loop and would require custom handling beyond a common interface. |
| **DeepSeek** | Uses OpenAI-like definitions, but the request field is "tools" (it accepts an array of tools with the same schema under a function key)[\[86\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=tools%20%3D%20%5B%20%7B%20,)[\[87\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=,). DeepSeek also supports a **strict mode** for function calling JSON: by using a beta endpoint and setting strict: true on function definitions, you can force the model to strictly adhere to the schema (or get an error if it outputs invalid JSON)[\[88\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=)[\[89\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=1.%20Use%20%60base_url%3D,error%20message%20will%20be%20returned). By default, it behaves like OpenAI (best-effort JSON adherence). | DeepSeek’s response for a function call includes an assistant message with a *tool call*. In their client example, after the first request, they do: tool \= message.tool\_calls\[0\][\[71\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=print%28f) – meaning the model’s answer contained a tool\_calls array with an entry (the requested function name and args). This is similar to Anthropic’s approach. They also populate the assistant message’s content (which might be empty or a placeholder). Notably, DeepSeek chooses to expose tool calls via a separate field *and* presumably a function\_call in the OpenAI-compatible output for compatibility. | The client must take the id of the tool call and provide a message with role: "tool". DeepSeek expects {"role": "tool", "tool\_call\_id": \<ID\>, "content": "\<function output\>"} as the way to return results[\[71\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=print%28f)[\[41\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=messages.append%28%7B,24%E2%84%83). This differs from OpenAI’s "function" role usage. Once the tool result is provided, the next model response (assistant role) will complete the answer. In an abstraction, you’d need to handle this slightly differently for DeepSeek: map a FunctionResult message in your interface to either a "function" role message (for OpenAI, etc.) or a "tool" role with ID (for DeepSeek/Claude). |
| **Perplexity** | Perplexity’s API primarily focuses on its built-in **search tool** (“Grounded LLM”). It doesn’t require developers to define functions for web search – the model will automatically perform searches and return an answer with citations. The API does support the OpenAI functions parameter for custom tool usage, but documentation is sparse on custom function calls (the emphasis is on their integrated search). It’s mentioned that the API is OpenAI-compatible, so we can assume defining functions is allowed and will be interpreted in a similar fashion. | If a custom function is defined and the model decides to call it, Perplexity would respond with a function\_call in an assistant message (just as OpenAI). However, the more common scenario is that the model uses *its own web search tool*: in that case, the “function call” (search query) and results retrieval are handled internally by Perplexity, and the final answer is given directly with sources. There isn’t an exposed function call for the client to handle in that flow. | For custom functions (if used), the client would respond with the function role message and result, as normal. But given Perplexity’s value proposition, one might not often use custom function calls – instead you rely on the model’s integrated search ability. So, in the context of ILanguageModelService, you might not implement function tool calls for Perplexity at all; or if you do, it works just like OpenAI’s flow. |

**Key Points:** Most providers align with OpenAI’s function calling design: you define tools via JSON in the request, the model’s reply indicates a function call, and you send the function’s output back for a final answer. The differences lie in nomenclature and **how strictly the schema is followed**:

* **Naming**: OpenAI uses "functions" and a function\_call field; Google/DeepSeek use "tools" with a similar substructure; Anthropic/xAI accept OpenAI’s fields; all conceptually equivalent. The role for returning results is "function" in OpenAI, but Anthropic/DeepSeek prefer a "tool" role message with an ID reference[\[40\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=tool%20%3D%20message.tool_calls).

* **Strictness**: OpenAI recently added a strict: true option (via their Assistants API) to enforce exact JSON outputs[\[90\]](https://community.openai.com/t/strict-true-and-required-fields/1131075#:~:text=Strict%3DTrue%20and%20Required%20Fields%21%20,AI%20API%20forces%20us). Anthropic currently ignores any strict flag[\[46\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,a%20single%20initial%20system%20message). DeepSeek **supports strict mode** via a special endpoint[\[88\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=)[\[89\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=1.%20Use%20%60base_url%3D,error%20message%20will%20be%20returned), validating the model’s arguments against the schema and erroring if it deviates – a feature unique to DeepSeek among these. This could be an abstraction challenge: only some backends can guarantee well-formatted JSON responses.

* **Autonomy**: Some platforms (Venice, Perplexity, Google’s Gemini) have *built-in tools* (web search, code execution, calculators, etc.) that the model can use without developer-defined functions. In an abstracted service, you might not represent these as “functions” at all – they are implicitly available based on model or parameters. For example, Perplexity’s model will autonomously do web searches; Venice’s model can be enabled to search by a parameter. The ILanguageModelService design might treat these as **provider-specific capabilities** rather than user-defined tools.

In summary, function calling can be standardized in the abstraction (to a concept of tool definitions and results), but the implementation per provider will need adapters: e.g. mapping to "functions" vs "tools" field names, handling role name differences for function results, and enabling/disabling strict mode if supported. It’s wise to design the interface with a **flexible tool-calling workflow** – for instance, a ToolDefinition class (name, description, parameters) and a way to capture a model’s function-call request (perhaps as a special message type or event), so the client can act on it and then continue the conversation with the function’s result.

# Provider-by-Provider Analysis

This section provides a deep dive into each target provider’s API, highlighting how to call it (with examples in cURL or C\#), and unique features or pitfalls when integrating into a unified service.

## OpenAI API (GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo)

**Authentication & Endpoint:** OpenAI’s API uses a secret key with Bearer token auth: e.g. Authorization: Bearer sk-... in the header[\[3\]](https://www.newapi.ai/en/api/openai-chat/#:~:text=Authentication%20Method%C2%B6). The chat completion endpoint is POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions. (OpenAI’s API is the de-facto standard that many others emulate.)

**Request Format:** JSON with your chosen model (e.g. "gpt-4" or "gpt-3.5-turbo"), and a messages array. Each message has a role (system, user, or assistant – plus function in function-call contexts) and content string[\[26\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=The%20format%20of%20a%20basic,chat%20completion%20is)[\[27\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=System%20role). The first message can be a system role to set instructions or context[\[27\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=System%20role). For example:

{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "messages": \[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who founded Microsoft?"}
  \],
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "max\_tokens": 200,
  "stream": false
}

Optional parameters include temperature, top\_p, n (for multiple responses), stop sequences, presence\_penalty, frequency\_penalty, etc. Function calling is enabled by adding a functions array (with definitions) and (optionally) function\_call instructions. For instance, you might include:

"functions": \[
  {
    "name": "getWeather",
    "description": "Get current weather for a city",
    "parameters": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": { "city": {"type": "string"} },
       "required": \["city"\]
    }
  }
\],
"function\_call": "auto"

to allow the model to call a function getWeather. If the model decides to use it, it will produce a function\_call in the response.

**Response Format:** The response will contain an id, object ("chat.completion"), created timestamp, and an array choices. Usually you request one completion (n=1), so you get choices\[0\]. Each choice has an index, a message object, and a finish\_reason[\[56\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=%7B%20%22id%22%3A%20%22chatcmpl,and%20Chief%20Software%20Architect%20until)[\[57\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=%22created%22%3A%201698892410%2C%20%22model%22%3A%20%22gpt,). The **assistant**’s reply is in choices\[0\].message.content (for a normal answer)[\[79\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=,null). Token usage is reported in a usage object[\[57\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=%22created%22%3A%201698892410%2C%20%22model%22%3A%20%22gpt,). If function calling was used, the process yields multiple interactions: 1\. The first response’s choices\[0\].message will include a function\_call field (with name and arguments) instead of content. 2\. You then call your external function and send back a new message (role": "function") with the result. 3\. The model replies again with an assistant message containing the final answer.

**Streaming:** OpenAI supports streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE). Set stream: true in the request, and read the response as a stream of data: ... events. Each event’s JSON will contain incremental delta content for the message (e.g. the first event might contain the role and first few words, subsequent events contain further content fragments)[\[91\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=)[\[92\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=curl%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fgenerativelanguage.googleapis.com%2Fv1beta%2Fopenai%2Fchat%2Fcompletions%22%20%5C%20,true). The stream ends with a data: \[DONE\] message. In C\#, you can use an HttpClient to read the response body as a stream and parse event by event. The streaming format is fairly consistent across OpenAI and compatible endpoints.

**Example (cURL):**

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\
 \-H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI\_API\_KEY" \\
 \-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
 \-d '{
      "model": "gpt-4",
      "messages": \[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who founded Microsoft?"}\],
      "max\_tokens": 100
 }'

This returns a JSON with the assistant’s answer (e.g. “Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen…”) inside choices\[0\].message.content[\[79\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt#:~:text=,null).

**Integration Considerations:** OpenAI’s API is well-documented and stable. For a unified interface, OpenAI can act as the baseline. Note that OpenAI is rolling out new features via the “Assistants API” (also referred to as “OpenAI Agents”), which allow creating persistent agents with tool usage and even *strict JSON mode* for outputs[\[93\]](https://wandb.ai/onlineinference/genai-research/reports/Mastering-function-calling-with-OpenAI--VmlldzoxMzQ1MDk1NQ#:~:text=Mastering%20function%20calling%20with%20OpenAI,strictly%20conform%20to%20your%20schema). These are essentially higher-level orchestrations on top of function calling. Such features (if used) may not translate to other providers, so one must either restrict to common denominators or implement provider-specific branches. Also, OpenAI has specific rate limits and payload size limits to consider, but those are beyond the scope of interface design.

**.NET Integration:** No official OpenAI .NET SDK exists (as of 2025). Many developers use the REST API via HttpClient, or community libraries like Azure.AI.OpenAI (which can actually connect to OpenAI by setting the base URI to OpenAI’s endpoint and providing the key) or **OpenAI.NET**. In an ILanguageModelService, one would implement a class (say OpenAIService) that formulates the HTTP request as above, and parses the response JSON into the common model (converting OpenAI’s choices\[0\].message into your ChatMessage object, etc.). Streaming can be handled by reading the HTTP response stream.

OpenAI’s function calling convention (with function role messages) can be taken as the default for the abstraction – other providers’ differences (like using a tool role) can be converted at the edges.

## Anthropic Claude API

**Overview:** Anthropic’s Claude model is exposed via its own API, which differs from OpenAI’s in some ways. However, Anthropic also provides an **OpenAI-compatible endpoint** as a convenience: developers can use OpenAI SDKs pointed at api.anthropic.com/v1 with an Anthropic API key[\[25\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=1,for%20what%20features%20are%20supported)[\[94\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=api_key%3D%22ANTHROPIC_API_KEY%22%2C%20%20,the%20Claude%20API%20endpoint). This compatibility layer is intended for quick evaluation and has some limitations[\[95\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=This%20compatibility%20layer%20is%20primarily,please%20let%20us%20know%20here), but it shows Anthropic’s recognition of the OpenAI schema as a standard.

**Authentication:** Anthropic uses an API key sent as a header x-api-key: \<key\>[\[4\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=curl%20https%3A%2F%2Fapi.anthropic.com%2Fv1%2Fmessages%20%5C%20,20240620%22%2C%20%22max_tokens%22%3A%201024%2C%20%22messages%22%3A). You must also specify an anthropic-version header with the API version date (e.g. anthropic-version: 2023-06-01)[\[4\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=curl%20https%3A%2F%2Fapi.anthropic.com%2Fv1%2Fmessages%20%5C%20,20240620%22%2C%20%22max_tokens%22%3A%201024%2C%20%22messages%22%3A). These are required for the Claude API calls. (In OpenAI-compat mode, the OpenAI SDK would actually just send the key as a Bearer token – Anthropic’s compatibility layer accepts that and likely maps it to the internal key, according to their docs. But when calling directly with HttpClient, use the x-api-key header.)

**Endpoint:** The chat endpoint is POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages for the **Claude “Messages” API**[\[96\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=Copy). This endpoint expects a conversation and returns the next assistant message (similar to chat completions). There is also a legacy completion endpoint (/v1/complete) for the older prompt-based API, but for chat we use /v1/messages. The request and response format described here refers to the Claude 2/Claude 3 chat API.

**Request Format:** The required fields are: \- model: e.g. "claude-2" or "claude-instant-1" or Claude 2.1, etc. Model IDs tend to include version/date (e.g. "claude-3-5-24b-sonnet"). \- messages: an array of messages in Anthropic’s format. Anthropic supports roles: "system" (or "developer" – effectively the same usage in Claude), "user", "assistant", and uses "system" only as the first message. Internally, Anthropic only allows one system/developer message at the start, so if you include multiple system messages in the array, **Claude will concatenate them** in order to fit its format[\[31\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=System%20%2F%20Developer%20message%20hoisting).

Other fields: \- max\_tokens: maximum tokens for the completion (Claude uses this similarly to OpenAI)[\[97\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=,%7C%20jq). \- temperature, top\_p: sampling settings (note: Anthropic’s temperature range is 0 to 1; if higher values are given, they cap at 1\)[\[98\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,Ignored). \- stream: boolean to enable streaming responses[\[99\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=Copy). \- stop: a list of stop sequences (Claude will stop **when any** of the sequences is generated, unlike OpenAI which stops at the first, but effectively similar behavior). \- Claude-specific: it doesn’t use presence/frequency penalties in this chat API (those parameters will be ignored if provided)[\[45\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,Ignored). It also has some features like metadata or tags for internal tracking, but those are optional and not relevant for content.

**Example Request (Claude):**

{
  "model": "claude-3.5-sonnet-20240620",
  "messages": \[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who founded Microsoft?"}
  \],
  "max\_tokens": 512,
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "stream": false
}

This would ask Claude (v3.5 Sonnet) the question. Claude will see the system instruction and user query.

**Response Format:** Anthropic’s native response looks like:

{
  "id": "msg\_012899dyMDyCX4FgMNNbao8k",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
  "content": \[
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Hello\! Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975..."
      }
  \],
  "stop\_reason": "stop\_sequence",
  "stop\_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input\_tokens": 50,
    "output\_tokens": 30
  }
}

A few things to note: \- The assistant’s content is an **array of content parts**[\[65\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=%22role%22%3A%20%22assistant%22%2C%20%22model%22%3A%20%22claude,%7D). Here it’s one object of type “text”. If Claude returned any rich content (like code, or a citation, etc.), it might segment it, but usually it’s just a single text segment. \- stop\_reason indicates why it stopped (could be end\_turn or max\_tokens etc.)[\[100\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=%5D%2C%20,30). \- Token usage is given as input\_tokens and output\_tokens (the naming is slightly different from OpenAI’s prompt/completion, but analogous).

If streaming, the response is sent as **event-stream** with several event types (this is quite unique to Anthropic): \- message\_start event (with an empty message object stub), \- then multiple content\_block\_delta events carrying pieces of text[\[101\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=event%3A%20ping%20data%3A%20%7B)[\[102\]](https://cocalc.app/github/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/blob/main/docs/anthropic_api.md#:~:text=event%3A%20content_block_delta%20data%3A%20%7B,), \- then a message\_done or message\_stop at end. In practice, if you use their compatibility layer, you might not see this complexity as it might translate to OpenAI-style delta events. But using the Claude API directly, you have to handle these event types. Each content\_block\_delta has an index (for which content part it’s updating, usually 0 for the main text) and a text fragment.

**Function Calling in Claude:** Historically, Claude did not support function calling in the same explicit JSON way. Developers would either: \- Provide tool outputs via the conversation (like inserting “Assistant: Let’s use tool X…” as text). \- Or use Anthropic’s newer *MCP (Model Context Protocol)* where you can specify tools and have the model output a special token to indicate a tool use (not JSON-based like OpenAI’s).

However, as of Claude 2 and 3, Anthropic has **added support for function calling through the OpenAI-compatibility approach**. In their official docs, they map OpenAI’s functions schema to Claude’s behavior[\[103\]\[104\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=). When you supply functions, Claude will output a JSON-looking invocation. The compatibility layer captures it in a tool\_calls list in the response message[\[34\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=%60choices,Fully%20supported). Each entry has an id, function name, and arguments. You then provide the result with a message role "tool" referencing that id[\[71\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=print%28f). This is a bit more involved than OpenAI’s, but it achieves the same end result.

**OpenAI Compatibility Mode:** If you use the OpenAI SDK pointed to Claude (base\_url api.anthropic.com/v1), you would send the same JSON as OpenAI. Claude will **ignore** certain unsupported fields rather than erroring[\[45\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,Ignored). For example, presence\_penalty in the request will do nothing (Claude doesn’t support it)[\[45\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,Ignored). The response you get will be formatted like OpenAI’s (with a choices array, etc.), but behind the scenes it’s just wrapping the Claude output. Anthropic warns that this layer is not 100% the same as using Claude’s native API (and that some Claude features like very long context, “extended thinking”, etc. are only in the native API)[\[105\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=OpenAI%20SDK%20compatibility%20feature%2C%20please,let%20us%20know%20here)[\[106\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=For%20the%20best%20experience%20and,using%20the%20native%20Claude%20API).

**Unique Features:** Claude models are known for very large context windows (100k tokens in Claude-Long, etc.) and an **“extended thinking”** mode (akin to allowing the model more reasoning steps). The Claude API offers a enable\_extended\_thinking flag via a special header or parameter in some versions. There’s also a feature called “Claude Instant” vs full Claude (trading speed for capability).

For the purposes of abstraction: \- You might treat Anthropic mostly via its OpenAI compatibility interface to simplify integration. If so, your implementation for Anthropic in ILanguageModelService can essentially act just like OpenAI’s, with the caveat of a different URL and key header. \- However, be mindful that the **system message handling** is different: if your app tries to send multiple system messages in one conversation (which OpenAI supports), Anthropic will merge them. It’s usually fine, but instructions spread out might behave slightly differently. The Anthropic compat specifically “hoists” all system/developer messages to the start[\[31\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=System%20%2F%20Developer%20message%20hoisting). \- **Streaming** from Claude directly will require parsing their event types. If going through the OpenAI-compatible endpoint, verify if it sends events in OpenAI format (likely it does, but that might be in their docs). If not, you’ll need a custom SSE parser for Claude’s events.

**C\# Example (using HttpClient):**

var client \= new HttpClient();
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("x-api-key", anthropicApiKey);
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("anthropic-version", "2023-06-01");
var payload \= new {
    model \= "claude-2",
    messages \= new \[\] {
       new { role \= "system", content \= "You are a helpful assistant."},
       new { role \= "user", content \= "Who founded Microsoft?"}
    },
    max\_tokens \= 300
};
var response \= await client.PostAsJsonAsync("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", payload);
string json \= await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
// Then parse JSON to extract answer...

The answer will be in content\[0\].text of the returned JSON object.

**Integration Tips:** \- Implement an AnthropicService that either uses the compat mode (so it can reuse OpenAI parsing logic) or handles the native format. The compat mode might be easiest: you’d set base\_url to Anthropic and still parse as OpenAI. But note the differences mentioned (e.g. always one choice, tool calls via different field). \- You may need to adjust for **Claude’s single response**: i.e. if your interface tries to request n\>1 completions, on Anthropic you’ll get only one (Claude will ignore n). It’s probably acceptable to always use n=1 for all providers to keep things simple. \- Also, error handling: Anthropic errors might not be identical to OpenAI’s. They might return different HTTP status or error JSON. In compat mode, they claim to maintain consistent error formats with OpenAI’s, but details may differ[\[70\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=Error%20message%20compatibility). \- Rate limits and quotas differ too: Claude has its own limits (and requires an account with access).

In summary, Claude can be integrated without much friction if using its OpenAI-like interface. The main friction is the **tool usage** pattern (slightly different) and ensuring your abstraction doesn’t rely on features Claude doesn’t support (like multiple parallel responses or certain fine-grained controls). For features unique to Claude (e.g. the 100k context or “extended thinking”), you might expose them via provider-specific settings if needed (for instance, a property in your request class like AllowExtendedThinking that only AnthropicService pays attention to by adding the header).

## Google Gemini API (PaLM/Gemini via Google Cloud)

**Overview:** Google’s LLM offerings (PaLM 2, and the newer **Gemini** models) are accessible through Google Cloud’s Vertex AI or Generative Language API. Uniquely, Google provides an *OpenAI-compatible REST API* for Gemini[\[10\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=Gemini%20models%20are%20accessible%20using,call%20the%20Gemini%20API%20directly), making integration easier. They also have their native API endpoints and client libraries (which use different request/response schemas with Google-specific types).

**Authentication:** Requires a Google Cloud API key or OAuth2 token. In the compatibility examples, Google uses a Bearer token approach: you generate an API key in Google AI Studio and use it as Authorization: Bearer GEMINI\_API\_KEY[\[8\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=curl%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fgenerativelanguage.googleapis.com%2Fv1beta%2Fopenai%2Fchat%2Fcompletions%22%20%5C%20,to%20me%20how%20AI%20works). (This is a bit unusual, since typically Google Cloud APIs use keys in query params or OAuth tokens – but the docs show the key in Bearer, likely for compatibility mode).

**Endpoint:** For OpenAI-compat, the base URL is https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/[\[7\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=api_key%3D). Append chat/completions to that for the full endpoint[\[6\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=client%20%3D%20OpenAI%28%20api_key%3D,)[\[7\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=api_key%3D). Essentially, Google created an /openai sub-path that mimics OpenAI’s paths. When not in compatibility mode, the endpoint would be different (e.g. /v1beta2/models/{model}:generateMessage in Google’s own schema), but we focus on the compatibility one.

**Request Format:** Identical to OpenAI’s chat format. As shown in Google’s docs, you can literally use the OpenAI Python library and just swap the base\_url and model name[\[6\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=client%20%3D%20OpenAI%28%20api_key%3D,)[\[7\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=api_key%3D). So: \- model: use Google’s model names, e.g. "gemini-2.0-fast" or "gemini-2.5-pro" etc. (These might correspond to sizes or versions). \- messages: array of role/content pairs as usual. \- All typical parameters (temperature, top\_p, max\_tokens, stream, etc.) are accepted. If a parameter isn’t supported, Google likely ignores it or maps it. For instance, Google’s native API has top\_p and temperature, but doesn’t have frequency/presence penalties (PaLM API had something called repetition\_penalty maybe). The compatibility layer likely ignores penalties if not applicable.

Google extends the functionality with: \- **Reasoning/Thinking mode**: The Gemini models can perform more reasoning steps. In compat mode, they introduced a parameter reasoning\_effort which can be "low", "medium", "high" to control how much the model “thinks” (this corresponds to internal tokens allocated for chain-of-thought)[\[48\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=Gemini%202,much%20the%20model%20will%20think). If you don’t set it, it defaults to some model behavior. (OpenAI has no direct equivalent, though one could argue GPT-4’s function of giving intermediate thoughts is somewhat analogous.) \- **Function calling (Tools)**: As discussed, include a tools array in the request with function definitions[\[80\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=%22model%22%3A%20%22gemini,function)[\[81\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=,), and tool\_choice to control usage[\[82\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=model%3D%22gemini). Google’s models also have built-in tools (like web search if allowed, code execution, etc.) but in OpenAI-compat mode you would only see those if Google mapped them somehow. According to their docs, function calling **is supported** and works like OpenAI’s[\[68\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=Function%20calling)[\[107\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=Function%20calling%20makes%20it%20easier,supported%20in%20the%20Gemini%20API).

**Response Format:** When using the compatibility endpoint, Google assures the response will match OpenAI’s schema (they encourage switching to their native SDK later for more features, but compatibility is for ease)[\[10\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=Gemini%20models%20are%20accessible%20using,call%20the%20Gemini%20API%20directly)[\[108\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=your%20Gemini%20API%20key,call%20the%20Gemini%20API%20directly). So you get:

{
  "id": "chatcmpl-12345...",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": ...,
  "model": "gemini-2.5",
  "choices": \[ { "index":0, "message": { "role": "assistant", "content": "..." }, "finish\_reason": "stop" } \],
  "usage": { ... }
}

One thing to highlight: Google’s models being multimodal means the messages.content can be not just a string but an array of segments (some of type “text”, some “image”). In the compatibility mode, they demonstrated how to send an image by including {"role": "user", "content": \[ { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"}, {"type": "image\_url", "image\_url": { "url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,\<...\>" } } \] }[\[36\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=,)[\[109\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=%7B%20,). The response from the model might similarly have structured content (like references to image analysis). However, the OpenAI schema for content in a message is defined as string or array? In OpenAI’s newer documentation, content can indeed be an array for multi-part content[\[110\]](https://www.newapi.ai/en/api/openai-chat/#:~:text=Property%20Type%20Required%20Description%20,participants%20with%20the%20same%20role)[\[111\]](https://www.newapi.ai/en/api/openai-chat/#:~:text=,participants%20with%20the%20same%20role). So Google likely uses that to return e.g. image descriptions or such.

**Streaming:** Google’s compat supports stream: true. The example given uses the OpenAI Node SDK, iterating over for await (const chunk of completion) and printing chunk.choices\[0\].delta.content[\[91\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=)[\[112\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=for%20await%20,console.log%28chunk.choices%5B0%5D.delta.content%29%3B%20%7D). This suggests Google sends SSE events in the same format as OpenAI (with a delta). Likely they even use data: \[DONE\] to terminate. So from an integration standpoint, streaming should just work by reading events as usual.

**Function Call Example:** (From Google’s docs)

tools \= \[
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "get\_weather",
      "description": "Get the weather in a given location",
      "parameters": {
         "type": "object",
         "properties": {
            "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state, e.g. Chicago, IL"},
            "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": \["celsius","fahrenheit"\]}
         },
         "required": \["location"\]
      }
    }
  }
\]
response \= openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    messages=\[{"role": "user","content": "What's the weather in Chicago today?"}\],
    tools=tools,
    tool\_choice="auto"
)

[\[113\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=messages%20%3D%20%5B%7B,flash%22%2C%20messages%3Dmessages%2C%20tools%3Dtools%2C%20tool_choice%3D%22auto%22)[\[114\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=curl%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fgenerativelanguage.googleapis.com%2Fv1beta%2Fopenai%2Fchat%2Fcompletions%22%20%5C%20,flash%22%2C%20%22messages%22%3A%20%5B)

This mirrors the OpenAI function call usage. The model might respond with e.g. function name get\_weather and args, which you then fulfill.

**Integration Considerations:** Google’s API via OpenAI-compat is straightforward. The friction could come if you want to use features that aren’t in OpenAI: \- For example, Google’s models allow **longer context** (Gemini might have large context windows) and **“thinking” tokens**. If you want to expose the reasoning\_effort parameter, you might add it to your abstraction as an optional setting (maybe as part of a ModelSettings object) for providers that support it. \- Also, Google’s rate limiting or error responses might be different (the HTTP status codes or error fields). \- **Model IDs**: Google’s model naming scheme (e.g. "gemini-2.5-pro" vs OpenAI’s "gpt-4") might need mapping if your system picks models by some abstract capability. You might allow an alias like “gemini\_latest” in your config and map it to actual model name per provider.

No official .NET SDK means you’ll use HttpClient. If you already support OpenAI in your service, adding Google is mostly a matter of changing endpoint and handling auth.

One potential complication: Google Cloud’s API might require enabling the service and setting up billing in a Google Cloud project. So keys might be tied to projects and quotas. But from a code perspective, it’s just another endpoint with a header.

**Conclusion for Google:** Integration friction is low thanks to the compatibility API[\[10\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=Gemini%20models%20are%20accessible%20using,call%20the%20Gemini%20API%20directly). But to harness all of Gemini’s power, one might need to eventually use Google’s native API (for example, fine-tuning or using specific Google tools). Those native calls would not fit the OpenAI pattern, meaning your abstraction might not cover them. In a vendor-agnostic design, you’d typically stick to the common subset – which in Google’s case is covered by the OpenAI-like interface.

## Venice.AI API

**About:** Venice.AI is a privacy-focused AI platform that offers several models (some fine-tuned or based on open-source like Qwen, Mistral, etc.) via a unified API. They explicitly market **zero data retention** and “no spying”, which appeals for enterprise use. For integration, the key point is Venice’s API is **OpenAI-compatible for chat and more**[\[13\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=OpenAI%20Compatibility).

**Auth & Endpoint:** Simple – use the endpoint https://api.venice.ai/api/v1/chat/completions with Bearer token auth[\[12\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=curl%20https%3A%2F%2Fapi.venice.ai%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fchat%2Fcompletions%20%5C%20,). The API key can be generated on their platform. The cURL example in their docs is literally the same as OpenAI’s, just a different URL and model name[\[11\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=curl%20https%3A%2F%2Fapi.venice.ai%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fchat%2Fcompletions%20%5C%20,).

**Request Format:** Identical to OpenAI’s chat completion. You send model, messages, etc. The model IDs for Venice correspond to various underlying models: \- For example, model: "venice-uncensored" or model: "qwen3-235b" etc. They list “Current Models” in their docs with IDs[\[115\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Copy%20a%20Model%20ID%20and,in%20your%20requests)[\[116\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Unfiltered%20generation%20Model%20ID%3A%20%60venice,for%3A%20uncensored%20creative%2C%20red%E2%80%91team%20testing). Some are clearly based on other projects (Qwen, Mistral, etc.) but Venice likely fine-tuned or optimized them. \- All OpenAI parameters (temperature, top\_p, max\_tokens, presence\_penalty, etc.) appear to be supported or at least accepted (they don’t explicitly list which are supported, but by claiming OpenAI compatibility, one assumes the standard ones work).

**Response Format:** Follows OpenAI’s. So you get a choices array with an assistant message, and a usage object. (They didn’t show a raw response in docs, but since they say “familiar interface”, it’s safe to treat it as the same structure.)

**Function Calling & Tools:** Venice supports function calling and also boasts **built-in tools**: \- Built-in tools include **Web Search**, **Code execution**, **Vision (image analysis)**, etc. They say these can be toggled on compatible models using either special parameters or by using “model suffixes”[\[51\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Extend%20models%20with%20built%E2%80%91in%20tools)[\[52\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Vision%20Processing). For example, they mention a model “Mistral 3.1 24B” that *supports Vision, Function calling, image analysis*[\[117\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Venice%20Medium%203). They might have a naming convention like adding “-vision” to a model to enable image input, or adding “-tools” to enable a web search agent mode. \- For custom tools (function calling ala OpenAI), Venice uses the same approach. In their documentation or integration guides, they refer to function calling under the hood (the mention of “tool use / APIs”[\[118\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Image%20understanding) and a “Function Calling” toggle).

From an integration standpoint, using Venice is just like using OpenAI, with some optional enhancements: \- If you want the model to have web access, you might set a flag. Possibly the API expects an extra field in the request JSON like:

"venice\_parameters": { "web\_search": true }

or maybe you append \-web to the model name. The docs show *Web Search Code Samples* separately, implying you do something extra to get web search[\[119\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Model%20Suffix)[\[120\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Ask%20AI). In the cURL for web search, they might show a parameter or a special model. \- They mention “model suffixes” as an approach – perhaps using model ID qwen3-235b:web or similar (this is speculative; they didn’t show the exact usage in text we saw).

**Example (cURL):**

curl https://api.venice.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \\
  \-H "Authorization: Bearer $VENICE\_API\_KEY" \\
  \-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  \-d '{
        "model": "venice-uncensored",
        "messages": \[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello World\!"}\]
      }'

[\[12\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=curl%20https%3A%2F%2Fapi.venice.ai%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fchat%2Fcompletions%20%5C%20,)

This would return a chat completion from their “uncensored” model.

**Notable Features:** \- **No data retention:** While not directly affecting API integration, it means you don’t get things like conversation history saved on their side – every request must include all context. That’s similar to OpenAI (which doesn’t remember past calls unless you send them), so it aligns well. \- **Customizability:** They have an **AI Characters** feature, possibly allowing predefined personas (the mention of “Characters API” with create/list personas[\[121\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Chat%20Completions%20Text%20%2B%20reasoning,60%2B%20multilingual%20voices%2022%20AI)). That might be a separate endpoint or just a concept of system prompts. \- **Vision inputs:** Their flagship models support image input (vision), and they mention “Describe this image” example[\[117\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Venice%20Medium%203). How to send an image? Possibly as Base64 in a message content (similar to Google’s approach, or they might have an endpoint for image upload). If needing to incorporate that, an abstraction could have to allow non-text content.

**Integration Considerations:** Venice’s API is one of the easier to plug in since it explicitly mirrors OpenAI. For the unified service: \- You can treat Venice like OpenAI by default. For any special features (web search, uncensored mode toggles), you might include a generic mechanism for “provider extensions.” For example, you could allow ChatRequest.ProviderSettings to carry a dictionary or a typed object that VeniceService can read (e.g. an object that has EnableWebSearch flag). Alternatively, you allow specifying the exact model name which includes the mode (like using their combined model name if that’s how it’s done). \- Tool usage (function calling) should work transparently. If function calling is not supported on a given model, presumably the model will just ignore the functions (or return an error). According to their model list, the Mistral 3.1 24B supports function calling[\[117\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=Venice%20Medium%203), likely others do as well. It might be safe to attempt to use functions and expect it to either work or the model to just not invoke them if unsupported. \- **Streaming**: They haven’t explicitly documented it in the snippet we saw, but given compatibility, they likely support stream: true with SSE events. When designing your service, test if streaming works (maybe check their Postman collection or changelogs). If not, you might have to fall back to non-stream for Venice or manually chunk if possible. But most likely it does stream – it’d be odd for a chat API not to nowadays.

**Error handling:** Ensure to capture any differences in error response. If they follow OpenAI, errors might come in a similar JSON with an error field and message.

Overall, **Venice** has low integration friction. It ranks as easy to integrate as OpenAI itself, with additional toggles that are purely additive. The only caution is ensuring none of those toggles break the abstraction (for example, if a toggle causes multiple responses or different output format – but from docs, it still returns in the normal format, just content might include citations or images).

## xAI Grok API

**About:** xAI is Elon Musk’s AI venture. **Grok** is their flagship model. The xAI API (currently in beta/enterprise mode) is documented to be “fully compatible with the OpenAI REST API”[\[17\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=The%20xAI%20Enterprise%20API%20is,with%20the%20OpenAI%20REST%20API), which is great for integration. They also offer some unique features like reasoning mode and “collections” (a vector store) to augment Grok.

**Auth & Endpoint:** Base URL: https://api.x.ai/v1[\[14\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=The%20base%20for%20all%20routes,your%20xAI%20API%20key). The chat completions path is /v1/chat/completions (just like OpenAI)[\[122\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=Chat%20completions). Authentication is via Authorization: Bearer \<xAI API key\> header[\[15\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=capabilities%20with%20full%20compatibility%20with,the%20OpenAI%20REST%20API) – straightforward.

**Request Format:** Exactly the same JSON as OpenAI. The xAI docs literally say “full compatibility with the OpenAI REST API” and list the same routes (they even list /v1/completions (legacy), /v1/embeddings, etc., indicating they implemented those as well)[\[123\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=models%20Get%20language%20model%20,legacy)[\[17\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=The%20xAI%20Enterprise%20API%20is,with%20the%20OpenAI%20REST%20API). So: \- model: xAI model names (e.g. "grok-4" or their version naming). They have different versions like Grok-4, Grok-4-fast, etc., which vary in speed vs reasoning. \- messages: role/content pairs as usual. \- Standard params (temperature, top\_p, etc.) are supported. Their documentation in the menu has sections for “Chat with Reasoning”, “Function Calling”, “Structured Outputs”, etc., implying you can set parameters to trigger those modes. Possibly they have extra fields like "reasoning": true or something, but they might also simply require hitting a different model or endpoint for those capabilities.

For example, they mention **Stateful Response API** and **Deferred Completions** – those are like advanced features (maybe queue up a request or maintain a conversation state server-side). But if we stick to the basic chat/completions, it’s the OpenAI way.

**Function Calling:** xAI supports function calling. Given their compatibility, you define functions in the request. Grok is known to support tools and the docs have a “Function Calling” guide. There’s likely no twist here – they just do it like OpenAI. Perhaps one difference: xAI’s Grok might be particularly good at **code** and might have some internal tools (like a web search via Twitter? since Musk hinted it might have real-time info, but that could just be speculation). If any internal tool use exists, it might not surface via this API unless they explicitly integrate it.

**Response Format:** Same as OpenAI. The xAI Reference lists the same endpoints and indicates the responses have no differences in structure[\[17\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=The%20xAI%20Enterprise%20API%20is,with%20the%20OpenAI%20REST%20API). They likely also return usage data, etc. One clue: They mention an object called “responses” (which might be something for their deferred API), but for chat completions it should be standard.

One difference to note: The **model name** “gpt-4o” appears in some references (like in an Azure example above) – xAI’s Grok-4 might also sometimes be referred to as GPT-4x or GPT-4 open? It’s not OpenAI’s model, but the naming might confuse if someone sees it. Ensure to use the correct model IDs given by xAI.

**Streaming:** Being OpenAI-compatible, yes. The SSE method should function. If using an OpenAI SDK or similar, it will just stream chunks. No evidence of a different mechanism.

**Unique xAI features:** \- **Reasoning Mode**: They highlight Grok’s advanced reasoning. Possibly if you want the model to show its reasoning or do multi-step, you might set a parameter. In their docs, “Chat with Reasoning” might mean the model will output a chain-of-thought if asked. But the API likely doesn’t require special flags for that; it might be that one of their model variants (e.g. grok-4-reasoning) automatically does it. \- **Collections**: xAI allows you to upload documents to a “Collections” (vector database) and then have the model use that data. This is not part of the chat completions call itself, but through separate endpoints (they have Collections API). In ILanguageModelService, you probably won’t handle that directly – but one could imagine extending the service to support retrieval-augmented generation by hooking into those endpoints behind the scenes for xAI. That, however, is provider-specific, so an agnostic interface might just skip it.

**Integration Considerations:** \- Very low friction since it mimics OpenAI. Implement an XaiService that just uses the base URL api.x.ai and key. Parse responses same as OpenAI. \- Watch out for *model availability*: xAI might only give access to certain orgs or have a waitlist. But once you have API keys, it’s straightforward. \- Rate limits or pricing might differ (though not asked here, but as a developer you’d want to handle too-many-requests errors gracefully).

**.NET usage:** No official .NET SDK, but they do have a Python SDK. For .NET, use HttpClient. For example:

httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization \= new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", xaiKey);
var request \= new {
    model \= "grok-4-fast",
    messages \= new \[\] { new {role="user", content="Tell me a joke."} }
};
var resp \= await httpClient.PostAsJsonAsync("https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions", request);

Parse accordingly.

**Conclusion for xAI:** Because xAI built their API with OpenAI compatibility in mind from day one[\[17\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=The%20xAI%20Enterprise%20API%20is,with%20the%20OpenAI%20REST%20API), integrating it into ILanguageModelService is essentially as easy as integrating a new OpenAI model. The only additions might be if you want to utilize xAI-specific features like their collection-augmented QA; those would require extending your interface (e.g. adding a method to load documents or a special parameter for “system knowledge base”). If not, you treat it as another chat completion provider.

## Meta Llama (via Azure/AWS or Self-Hosted)

**Context:** Meta’s Llama 2 (and Llama 3 in the future) is open-source and doesn’t have an official API hosted by Meta. To use Llama in a production app, you either host it yourself or use a third-party service. **Microsoft Azure** and **AWS Bedrock** are notable providers offering Llama-based models via their platforms. Additionally, some community-run endpoints (like Hugging Face Inference API or smaller cloud providers) provide OpenAI-like APIs for Llama.

Given the question’s scope, we’ll discuss how to integrate a Llama model in a vendor-agnostic way: \- If using **Azure**: Azure’s OpenAI Service *does not* include Llama (it only hosts OpenAI models). Instead, Azure suggests using their **Azure AI Foundry** or Azure ML with Hugging Face to deploy Llama. That approach would have a completely different interface (e.g. using Azure’s SDK or huggingface pipelines). \- If using **AWS Bedrock**: Bedrock has a unified API for various models. For example, if Bedrock offers Llama2, their API call might look like:

{
  "modelId": "ai.meta.llama2",
  "prompt": "...",
  "parameters": { ... }
}

and the response different. Bedrock’s API is *not* OpenAI-like; it’s a custom JSON and uses AWS Signature for auth. Integrating Bedrock alongside OpenAI would require writing a distinct adapter. \- **Hugging Face Inference API**: You can hit an endpoint like https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat with a Bearer token. That API expects a payload with a single field like {"inputs": "User: ... \\nAssistant:"} (depending on the model pipeline) and returns a completion. It’s not conversational unless you include the entire conversation in the prompt. HuggingFace also has a **transformers.js** or other OpenAI-compatible layers (for instance, some people use projects like **LocalAI** or **LMStudio** which spin up a local server that mimics OpenAI’s API for a local Llama model[\[18\]](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/app/api/endpoints/openai#:~:text=LM%20Studio%20accepts%20requests%20on,GET%20%2Fv1%2Fmodels%20POST%20%2Fv1%2Fchat%2Fcompletions)). \- **OpenRouter**: There is a project called OpenRouter that routes OpenAI API calls to various models (including some open ones). It might allow using an OpenAI format to reach a Llama model.

**Integration Approaches:** 1\. **Use an OpenAI-compatible wrapper for Llama** – For example, **LM Studio** (by Lightspeed) allows running Llama locally and accepts OpenAI API calls[\[124\]](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/app/api/endpoints/openai#:~:text=OpenAI%20Compatibility%20API%20,GET%20%2Fv1%2Fmodels%20POST%20%2Fv1%2Fchat%2Fcompletions). If a service like that is accessible (perhaps via an API gateway), you could treat it like another OpenAI endpoint. 2\. **Integrate via Bedrock API** – This requires writing a custom client for AWS Bedrock (signed requests, etc.) and mapping Bedrock’s request/response to your common format. It’s definitely doable, but Bedrock’s JSON is different: \- They don’t use roles; you just send a concatenated prompt (they have a convention like "\<user\>: ... \<assistant\>: ..." in the prompt if it’s a chat model, IIRC). \- The response is just the text output. So you’d need to embed the roles manually for context. \- Tool usage: Bedrock doesn’t have function calling yet, as far as known; you would handle it outside or not support it for those models.

1. **Hosted on a smaller provider**: Some startups (like the CometAPI site we saw, or Vercel’s AI SDK with Edge functions) might host Llama with OpenAI compatibility. For instance, CometAPI’s snippet shows an “API Lama 4”, presumably meaning Llama 2 70B as an API.

For a vendor-neutral design: \- If you absolutely need to incorporate Llama, you might choose one route (say, require the user to provide an endpoint that is OpenAI-compatible). For example, instruct users: “If you want to use Llama, set up an OpenAI-format API for it (like llama.cpp with OpenAI proxy) and configure the base URL.” This way, from the service perspective, it’s just another OpenAI-like provider (similar to how we handle DeepSeek, etc.). \- This is plausible because there are open-source projects that create such endpoints (e.g. **oobabooga/text-generation-webui** had an OpenAI API mode, **LocalAI** does as well). \- The disadvantage is requiring the user to do extra work to host it or trust a community API.

If we consider **Meta’s own stance**: they rely on partners (Azure, AWS). So likely an enterprise would integrate via those. In that case: \- **Azure**: You could call an Azure endpoint for Llama (maybe via Azure ML endpoint or a web service). That would be very custom (probably a REST endpoint you deploy that takes input and gives output). Hard to generalize. \- **AWS Bedrock**: Could incorporate into the abstraction by writing an IBedrockModelService implementing ILanguageModelService. It would need AWS SDK for signing or use their boto/HTTP interface. But Bedrock can host not just Llama but other models too, which is interesting because that one integration could cover Anthropic, AI21, etc. However, Bedrock’s approach to chat is not identical to OpenAI’s; you might have to assemble the prompt as a single string with all prior messages (and maybe special tokens) since their models expect one prompt.

**Conclusion for Llama:** There is no single straightforward “Llama API” to plug in. For an **architectural design**, you should still include it as a potential backend, but clarify that it requires a proxy or specific platform integration: \- If targeting open-source deployments, consider running an OpenAI-compatible server for the model (there are Docker images that do this for Llama 2). \- Emphasize that without a standard API, Llama integration has **higher friction** – the developer must either adapt to a cloud-specific API (like Bedrock) or rely on a community solution.

Ranking-wise, I would rank Meta Llama as having the *highest integration friction*, simply because it’s not plug-and-play REST like the others.

For completeness, let’s assume we use an OpenAI-compatible community endpoint: **Auth:** could be a simple Bearer token or even none if local. **Endpoint:** configurable (like http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions if local). **Request/Response:** would be identical to OpenAI (by design of that proxy). **Limitations:** These proxies might not support all features (e.g. function calling might or might not be implemented depending on the project; some support it by having the local model attempt JSON, others don’t).

In summary, to include Llama in ILanguageModelService, one approach is to allow a **custom provider** where the base URL and key can be set, assuming it speaks OpenAI’s protocol. That could cover Llama or any other open model the user sets up behind an OpenAI-like API.

## DeepSeek API

**About:** DeepSeek is a newer LLM (mentioned as cutting-edge and open in some contexts). The DeepSeek API appears to aim for compatibility and cost-effectiveness (claims of lower cost per token). From their docs, they explicitly use an OpenAI-like format[\[2\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/#:~:text=The%20DeepSeek%20API%20uses%20an,to%20access%20the%20DeepSeek%20API) and have some special features like “thinking mode” and context caching.

**Auth & Endpoint:** Base URL https://api.deepseek.com (they note you can use https://api.deepseek.com/v1 interchangeably for OpenAI compatibility, even though /v1 doesn’t denote a specific version of model)[\[20\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/#:~:text=PARAM%20VALUE%20base_url%20,apply%20for%20an%20API%20key). Auth is a Bearer token in the Authorization header[\[21\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/#:~:text=curl%20https%3A%2F%2Fapi.deepseek.com%2Fchat%2Fcompletions%20%5C%20,). So again very straightforward.

The primary route is POST /chat/completions (they don’t include the /v1 in the path in their cURL example, implying both /chat/completions and /v1/chat/completions work the same)[\[21\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/#:~:text=curl%20https%3A%2F%2Fapi.deepseek.com%2Fchat%2Fcompletions%20%5C%20,).

**Request Format:** Same fields as OpenAI: \- model: DeepSeek models include deepseek-chat (the default chat model) and deepseek-reasoner (the “thinking mode” version)[\[53\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/#:~:text=model%27s%20version). Recently they released DeepSeek V3.1 Terminus; deepseek-chat and deepseek-reasoner now correspond to modes of that model. \- messages: role-based chat history as usual. \- All common params: temperature, top\_p, max\_tokens, stream, etc. According to their compatibility notes, n must equal 1 (no multi completions)[\[74\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,Ignored), and they likely ignore logit bias and such if provided. \- They do have **additional modes**: “Reasoning Model” guide suggests if you pick the deepseek-reasoner model, the model will automatically do chain-of-thought reasoning (maybe like thinking out loud or using more tokens internally). Also “Chat Prefix Completion” and “FIM (fill in middle) Completion” are advanced features they have as separate guides – those might be accessed via different endpoints or parameters (they have a /v1/prefix-completions maybe). \- **Function Calling:** Provide a tools array in the request (instead of functions). Each tool definition looks like:

{
  "type": "function",
  "function": { ... same fields as OpenAI function schema ... }
}

as shown in their sample[\[86\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=tools%20%3D%20%5B%20%7B%20,)[\[87\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=,). It’s basically the same info, just wrapped differently. You also have the option to enable strict mode by adding "strict": true inside each function definition and hitting their /beta endpoint[\[88\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=)[\[89\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=1.%20Use%20%60base_url%3D,error%20message%20will%20be%20returned). In normal mode, strict is off (meaning model might deviate from schema).

**Response Format:** Generally matches OpenAI with one choice. However, DeepSeek extends the assistant message with a tool\_calls field for function use. Example from their docs: After initial request:

message \= response.choices\[0\].message
tool \= message.tool\_calls\[0\]

They retrieve the tool call[\[71\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=print%28f). So message.tool\_calls exists (like Anthropic’s approach) and contains an object with id, name, arguments. The message.content might be empty in that case or a placeholder.

Once the tool result is sent back, the final response will have the answer in message.content as usual.

If no function is used, you just get a normal assistant message content.

They also track usage: likely usage: { "prompt\_tokens": ..., "completion\_tokens": ... } akin to OpenAI.

**Streaming:** Yes, they support stream: true. The initial example mentions setting "stream": false for non-stream, implying true yields streaming[\[125\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/#:~:text=Once%20you%20have%20obtained%20an,to%20get%20stream%20response). Given their compatibility focus, they likely stream via SSE in the same way. Possibly they flush tokens as they’re generated, like OpenAI.

**Special Features:** \- **Thinking (Reasoning) Mode:** If model: "deepseek-reasoner", the model might output additional reasoning steps or just use more computation to give a better answer. Possibly it’s analogous to GPT-4 with longer thought, or maybe it will output a chain-of-thought. It might also use more tokens (they indicated DeepSeek V3.1 Terminus has two modes, one with “non-thinking” and one with “thinking”). \- **Context Caching:** They have a feature where repeated prompts can be cached for faster responses[\[126\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/#:~:text=,Lite%20Release%202024%2F11%2F20). That is not standard elsewhere. It might require sending some cache ID or enabling a setting. This is probably beyond a common interface – but if one wanted, they could allow a flag like EnableContextCaching in the request which the DeepSeek adapter would translate to whatever header or param DeepSeek expects. \- **Anthropic API bridging:** They mention an “Anthropic API” guide[\[127\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/#:~:text=,Other%20Resources), which suggests you can use DeepSeek’s platform to call Anthropic models as well. That’s interesting: they might act as a gateway to multiple models (like OpenRouter does). If that’s the case, a developer could theoretically call Anthropic via DeepSeek with the same interface. But for our design, we’d probably call Anthropics directly or whichever, not route through DeepSeek (unless it offered some advantage).

**Integration Considerations:** \- Very similar to Anthropic’s situation with function calls: The abstraction should account for tool\_calls list vs function\_call field. To reconcile, your ILanguageModelService could, for example, post-process DeepSeek’s response: if a function\_call is expected, convert their tool\_calls\[0\] into a unified FunctionCall object. Or simply detect that and handle accordingly (the client code might not even need to know if it came via tool\_calls – the service can encapsulate that). \- For returning function results, you must do what DeepSeek expects: a tool role message with the tool\_call\_id. This is a divergence from OpenAI, so the service’s implementation for DeepSeek has to override the generic behavior. A smart design might have something like:

if(provider \== Provider.DeepSeek)
     messages.Add(new ChatMessage { Role \= "tool", Content \= result, ToolCallId \= toolCall.Id });
else
     messages.Add(new ChatMessage { Role \= provider \== Provider.OpenAI ? "function" : "assistant", Name \= functionName, Content \= result });

etc., but ideally hide this logic in the DeepSeek adapter.

* **Strict Mode:** This is unique – none of the others (besides OpenAI’s own strict mode not widely documented yet) have this. If we want our abstraction to allow strict JSON enforcement, we could incorporate a parameter in ToolDefinition like Strict \= true. For providers that support it (DeepSeek, and possibly OpenAI’s Agents API in future), we use it; otherwise ignore. DeepSeek requires hitting a different base URL (/beta). We could internally handle that (e.g. DeepSeekService could check if any function has Strict and change the URL).

* They highlight support for **parallel tool calls** (parallel\_tool\_calls supported in their table[\[74\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,Ignored), which presumably means the model might call multiple functions in one answer?). That is exotic – OpenAI doesn’t do parallel calls. If DeepSeek can output multiple tool\_calls at once (maybe thinking ahead like planning to call two APIs), your interface might not anticipate that. You could decide not to support multiple simultaneous calls in the abstraction (handle one at a time), or if needed, treat it as sequential anyway.

**Ranking friction:** DeepSeek is fairly easy since it clones OpenAI’s API, but the function return mechanism is a twist that adds a bit of friction. Still, it’s smaller friction compared to something like Bedrock.

## Perplexity API (Grounded LLM “Sonar”)

**About:** Perplexity.ai is known for its search engine that answers questions with cited sources. They provide an API to developers offering **web-grounded LLM completions**. The key difference is that Perplexity’s model (called “Sonar”) can perform web searches and will always return answers with citations from the web. They also claim OpenAI compatibility for the API[\[22\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/getting-started/quickstart#:~:text=OpenAI%20SDK%20Compatible%3A%20Perplexity%E2%80%99s%20API,OpenAI%20SDK%20Guide%20for%20examples)[\[128\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=Ask%20AI).

**Auth & Endpoint:** The Perplexity API uses API keys (obtained from their developer portal). The base URL is https://api.perplexity.ai and for chat completions it’s likely the standard /v1/chat/completions (they haven’t explicitly published the path in what we saw, but since they mention OpenAI format, we infer that). Indeed, their guide shows using openai \= OpenAI(base\_url="https://api.perplexity.ai") and then openai.chat.completions.create(...)[\[128\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=Ask%20AI)[\[129\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=client%20%3D%20OpenAI%28%20api_key%3D,), implying the path is the same.

So in cURL it would be:

curl https://api.perplexity.ai/v1/chat/completions \\
 \-H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY\_API\_KEY" \\
 \-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
 \-d '{ "model": "sonar-pro", "messages": \[ ... \] }'

**Request Format:** Same as OpenAI. Use model: Perplexity currently has models like "sonar-pro" and perhaps "sonar-lite" (maybe a lighter version)[\[130\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/getting-started/quickstart#:~:text=,%5D). They might also have new model versions over time. The messages you provide can include context or even attachments (they have a guide “Working with Attachments” – presumably you can attach a PDF or image for the model to use, which is a form of retrieval augmentation). Standard params (temperature, max\_tokens etc.) are likely accepted; their docs confirm support for those standard OpenAI parameters[\[42\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=Standard%20OpenAI%20parameters).

Perplexity adds **search-specific parameters**: \- search\_domain\_filter: list of domains to include or exclude from web results[\[54\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=Perplexity). \- search\_recency\_filter: e.g. "day", "week", "month" to restrict how fresh the results are[\[131\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=These%20Perplexity,included). \- return\_images: boolean to allow image URLs in the answer. \- return\_related\_questions: boolean to get related questions in answer.

These are extra JSON fields that you can include. They demonstrate passing them via an extra\_body when using OpenAI SDK[\[55\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=%7B,%7D). In raw JSON, you’d just include them at top level next to messages.

If you don’t provide those, default behavior is a general web search.

**Function Calling:** It’s not explicitly discussed in what we saw. Possibly because Perplexity’s main “function” is the web search which is built-in. Does Perplexity allow custom function calls like OpenAI? Since they claim compatibility, their API might accept functions param and even attempt to honor it. The question is whether their model was trained for that. If Sonar is based on Llama or another base, it might not support function calling unless fine-tuned. They haven’t advertised function calling, so it might be unimplemented or experimental. If your abstraction passes functions to Perplexity, two outcomes: it might ignore them (the model doesn’t do function call), or maybe in the future they add support. So, for safety, either treat function calling as unsupported for Perplexity in your service (i.e. if user code tries to call a function via Perplexity backend, you could throw NotSupported or just let it try and see nothing happens).

**Response Format:** Matches OpenAI’s JSON (with choices, etc.)[\[72\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=%29%20print%28resp.choices)[\[73\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/chat-completions-guide#:~:text=Your%20responses%20will%20match%20OpenAI%E2%80%99s,below%20for%20complete%20field%20details). The content of the assistant message, however, will contain a fully formatted answer with Markdown and citation footnotes like “\[1\]”. Additionally, they append a “Search Results” section after the answer text with the list of sources (in markdown, as links with \[1\], \[2\] etc.). The raw JSON likely just provides this whole answer as the content string of the message. Possibly they also have a structured field for sources in the API, but their documentation shows the sources as part of the message content in markdown form[\[132\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/getting-started/quickstart#:~:text=,Results)[\[133\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/getting-started/quickstart#:~:text=).

No usage info is mentioned, but presumably they have usage like others do (or they might not yet, but to be safe we expect they do to track token counts for billing).

**Streaming:** Likely yes, since they mention streaming in quickstart. Actually, in their Quickstart they have separate code for “Non-streaming request” and “Streaming response” with their Python SDK[\[134\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/getting-started/quickstart#:~:text=Install%20the%20SDK%20first%3A%20,install%20perplexityai). The streaming likely streams the answer as it’s being generated (and possibly interim search steps? Unclear if they stream intermediate search results or just final answer progressively). But for our purpose, treat it as they stream tokens of the final answer via SSE in OpenAI format.

**Unique Features Integration:** \- The **grounded answer** means that just calling the API yields an answer with references. So, for a unified service, if the user wants an answer with real data, they can route to Perplexity. But it’s not just Q\&A: you can have a conversation with context and the model will still use the web as needed. This is a capability others don’t have out-of-the-box (except those with tools). \- If one wanted to emulate that for other models, they’d have to implement a retrieval function and use OpenAI’s function calling or tools. Perplexity does it internally. Nice for use but a bit “magic” inside. \- **Attachments**: They allow sending attachments (like you could attach a PDF to have it answer from it). That is done via an attachments endpoint or including base64 content perhaps. If supporting that in ILanguageModelService, one could generalize it as a type of message (e.g. a system message containing a document, or some Attachment property). But since it’s specific to Perplexity (and maybe xAI Collections somewhat similar concept), you might skip it in abstraction or handle via a generic “context documents” feature that only certain providers use.

**Integration Friction:** It’s mostly in *understanding that the model will always do web searches*. The interface doesn’t change – you still just call ChatAsync – but the behavior is different. For example, the response time might be longer because it’s searching, and if no internet is allowed it won’t work (so Perplexity needs external internet by design). If your application is offline or in a VPC with no egress, this provider wouldn’t function, unlike others.

From a coding perspective though, Perplexity is easy to integrate. Use the same OpenAI format. Just remember to include their specific fields if needed: e.g.

{
  "model": "sonar-pro",
  "messages": \[ ... \],
  "search\_mode": "web",
  "search\_domain\_filter": \["wikipedia.org"\],
  "return\_related\_questions": true
}

This would instruct it to search only Wikipedia and also return related questions in the answer.

If you don’t supply any, it will search the whole web. The results come back in the answer content.

One might want to parse the answer to extract the sources if needed. But that’s more at application level (to maybe display them nicely). The ILanguageModelService could just deliver the raw answer text.

**Conclusion for Perplexity:** It integrates like OpenAI with a couple of optional parameters. The main drawback is function calling and other tools – Perplexity’s focus is web search, so it doesn’t help if you wanted it to call, say, a calculator function (it would just search for a solution on the web rather than call your function).

Hence, in an abstract interface, you might mark **function calling not supported** for Perplexity, or attempt to use it but not rely on it working.

## Alibaba Cloud Qwen API

**About:** Qwen (Tongyi Qianwen) is Alibaba’s large model family. Alibaba provides access to Qwen via Alibaba Cloud’s **ModelScope or DashScope** services. They explicitly built an OpenAI-compatible API for Qwen[\[1\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=Since%20the%20APIs%20of%20Qwen,Max%20in%20Python). That means with the right endpoint and key, you can use Qwen just like OpenAI.

**Auth & Endpoint:** According to Qwen’s team blog, the base URL is https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1[\[24\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=from%20openai%20import%20OpenAI%20import,os) (for international, presumably a different for China region). This /compatible-mode/v1 path is exactly to mimic OpenAI. The auth uses an API key from Alibaba Cloud (likely a Bearer token as shown in the code snippet)[\[24\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=from%20openai%20import%20OpenAI%20import,os).

Alternatively, Qwen might also be accessible via ModelScope API with an app ID/secret using a slightly different call (ModelScope’s own format). But the easiest is the OpenAI-compatible mode.

**Request Format:** Same as OpenAI: \- model: use the Qwen model ID. In the example[\[135\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=completion%20%3D%20client.chat.completions.create%28%20model%3D%22qwen,%5D) they use "qwen-max-2025-01-25" – indicating Qwen2.5-Max model from Jan 25, 2025\. They have other models like Qwen-7B, Qwen-14B, etc., and possibly “-chat” or “-instruct” variants. You’d specify which one. \- messages: as usual (they gave an example with a simple system and user message)[\[135\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=completion%20%3D%20client.chat.completions.create%28%20model%3D%22qwen,%5D). \- Standard params: presumably supported. One notable thing: if Qwen’s base model doesn’t support function calling natively, they might not support functions. But I suspect by now they fine-tuned Qwen to handle function calls (the blog even mentions “information about Qwen for tool use”[\[136\]](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen#:~:text=QwenLM%2FQwen%3A%20The%20official%20repo%20of,Qwen%20for%20tool%20use), implying Qwen might support it). \- If using Alibaba’s official channel, you might have to include additional headers or a region, but the snippet suggests it’s just the base URL and key.

**Response Format:** Should follow OpenAI’s. That code snippet prints completion.choices\[0\].message and presumably it’s the assistant’s reply[\[135\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=completion%20%3D%20client.chat.completions.create%28%20model%3D%22qwen,%5D). We don’t have a raw JSON example, but no reason to think it deviates.

**Features:** Qwen is known for: \- Very large context (up to 128k tokens in some versions)[\[137\]](https://www.cometapi.com/ru/how-to-access-qwen-2-5/#:~:text=1). \- Multi-modality (some versions support vision, e.g. Qwen-VL). \- Possibly fine-tuned variants for math or code. \- If using via DashScope, the DashScope platform offers extra control (the CometAPI snippet implies DashScope allows tools and streaming)[\[138\]](https://www.cometapi.com/ru/how-to-access-qwen-2-5/#:~:text=%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C%20%D1%81%20OpenAI,%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%20%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%2C%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B0%20%D1%84%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2)[\[139\]](https://www.cometapi.com/ru/how-to-access-qwen-2-5/#:~:text=DashScope%20,%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%20%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%2C%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B0%20%D1%84%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2).

In fact, the CometAPI site in Russian summarized: “OpenAI compatibility /v1/chat/completions, pay-as-you-go… The DashScope API: same price; includes detailed control, tool use, streaming fragments”[\[140\]](https://www.cometapi.com/ru/how-to-access-qwen-2-5/#:~:text=match%20at%20L150%20%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C%20%D1%81,%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%20%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%2C%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B0%20%D1%84%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2)[\[141\]](https://www.cometapi.com/ru/how-to-access-qwen-2-5/#:~:text=%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C%20%D1%81%20OpenAI,%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%20%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%2C%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B0%20%D1%84%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2). That suggests: \- The “compatible-mode” is a quick way but maybe limited, \- The full DashScope API might have an endpoint where you can directly call tools or get partial outputs.

For our design, sticking to the OpenAI-compatible mode covers most needs: \- ILanguageModelService can send messages to Qwen just like to any OpenAI. \- If a special Qwen feature is needed (say image input for Qwen-VL), one could attempt to send an image like with Gemini (base64 in content) if Qwen’s API supports it. Not sure if they do through this compat mode. Possibly not initially.

**Integration Considerations:** \- Need an Alibaba Cloud account and enable ModelScope/DashScope, which gives an API key. There may be region and endpoint differences (the snippet used an “intl” endpoint, presumably if you’re outside China). \- Qwen compatibility is relatively new; ensure to handle any quirks. For instance, maybe Qwen’s usage is slightly different or some error codes are different. \- **Function calling**: If Qwen supports it, you can use it similarly. If not, the model might just ignore functions or try to answer without them. The medium article comparing GPT-4o and Qwen and DeepSeek might hint at whether Qwen did function call. It’s likely they’ll add it if not already. \- **Streaming**: They explicitly mention streaming is supported in DashScope (and likely in compat mode too). That means stream: true should yield SSE events. The snippet didn’t cover streaming, but we assume yes.

**Ranking friction:** Qwen is similar to others who made an OpenAI-like layer, so integration is straightforward. The slight friction could be obtaining and managing the Alibaba API credentials (since it’s a big cloud provider environment) and possibly some documentation in Chinese. But technically, it’s a minimal issue.

From an architecture perspective, Qwen’s inclusion means your interface should allow *very large context length* (maybe an attribute to inform chunking logic if any), and possibly support multi-modal (if they open that up like images).

However, since context length is not something you explicitly put in requests (aside from the prompt itself), it’s just a benefit that Qwen can handle more. You might still want to have a MaxContextLength property per model to decide truncation strategy in your service.

With all providers covered, we can now present:

# Architectural Recommendations

Designing a vendor-agnostic ILanguageModelService requires balancing **common abstraction** with **extensibility** for differences. We recommend the following structure for a C\#/.NET 8 implementation:

## Interface and Core Models

* **ILanguageModelService interface:** Define methods for core operations:

* ChatCompletionAsync(ChatRequest request) : Task\<ChatResponse\> – takes a request with messages and settings, returns the full response (or final assistant message).

* Optionally, methods like StreamChatCompletionAsync(ChatRequest request) : IAsyncEnumerable\<ChatStreamingChunk\> if you want to handle streaming at the service level (each chunk might contain partial message content).

* If needed, other methods like GetModelsAsync() to list available models, etc., which some providers support (OpenAI has /v1/models, others too).

* **ChatRequest class:** Encapsulate a conversation and generation parameters:

* List\<ChatMessage\> Messages – the conversation history.

* string Model – the model ID or name.

* Properties for parameters: double Temperature, double TopP, int MaxTokens, bool Stream, double? PresencePenalty, double? FrequencyPenalty, etc.

* List\<ToolDefinition\> Functions – list of functions the model can call (if any). We use “Functions” here for naming consistency in code, even if some APIs call them tools.

* FunctionCallSetting FunctionCall – could be an enum or struct to represent auto/none/force("name"). This corresponds to OpenAI’s function\_call field or others’ equivalent (tool\_choice).

* **Provider-specific extensions:** We suggest an optional dictionary or structured field. For example: Dictionary\<string, object\> ProviderSettings or a more typed approach (maybe a property PerplexitySettings of type PerplexityParams that includes SearchDomains, etc., which would be non-null only if using Perplexity). A simpler approach is ProviderSettings dictionary with keys like "search\_domain\_filter" that the provider adapter can read. This avoids bloating the base request with every possible vendor param, but still allows passing through things like Perplexity’s filters or Google’s reasoning mode. The service implementation for a given provider can check this dictionary for known keys.

* **ChatMessage class:** Represents a message in the conversation:

* string Role – use a unified set of roles: "system", "user", "assistant", and possibly "function" for the function result. (We can internally map "function" to "tool" for those providers that need it.)

* string Content – the text content of the message.

* string Name – optional, for cases where a name is needed (OpenAI allows naming a system message or function name goes here for function role messages).

* We might include an ID or metadata, but not usually needed from caller side.

* **Note:** We exclude any provider-specific fields like tool\_call\_id; those will be handled internally by the provider’s service class when constructing requests or interpreting responses.

* **ToolDefinition class:** (or FunctionDefinition):

* string Name

* string Description

* object Parameters – we can store the JSON Schema as a C\# object (perhaps use System.Text.Json.Nodes.JsonObject to represent the schema, or define a small class structure for it). This schema needs to be serializable exactly as required.

* Possibly a bool Strict if we want to support strict mode flags.

* We can also add a Delegate Implementation (function pointer) if we wanted the service to automatically execute it, but that’s likely out of scope – probably the calling code will handle execution when a function is requested by the model.

* **ChatResponse class:** Represents the result of a completion:

* List\<ChatMessage\> Choices – typically one choice, but list to mirror OpenAI (some providers might return multiple if asked).

* string FinishReason – e.g. “stop” or “max\_tokens”.

* UsageInfo Usage – with token counts (Prompt, Completion, Total).

* For function calls, perhaps include a structured representation as well: e.g. FunctionCall FunctionCall object if the model’s answer was a function request (OpenAI’s library surfaces it as part of message, but we can choose to break it out). However, since ChatMessage can include that data (e.g. Role=assistant with Content empty and Name=function\_name and maybe we put arguments somewhere), it might be simpler to embed it in ChatMessage.

* (Alternatively, we keep ChatMessage content as the raw content, and if a function call occurs, we set ChatMessage.Content \= null and use ChatMessage.Name for function name and attach a separate property for arguments. This is a bit clunky in pure C\# terms, so maybe better to have ChatMessage.FunctionCall property of a FunctionCall type, which if non-null indicates the assistant is asking for a function. That FunctionCall can have Name and Arguments.)

* **FunctionCall class:** with Name and Arguments (as a raw JSON string or a dictionary). This helps encapsulate function call requests from the model.

## Implementation Strategy (Providers):

Use the **Strategy pattern** or similar: have separate classes that implement ILanguageModelService for each provider: \- e.g. OpenAIService, ClaudeService, GeminiService, VeniceService, XaiService, DeepSeekService, PerplexityService, QwenService. \- Each knows how to convert the ChatRequest into that provider’s HTTP request, and how to parse the response into ChatResponse.

A factory or a higher-level router can choose the service implementation based on a configured provider for a given model or context: \- e.g. ILanguageModelService GetServiceForProvider(string providerName) or simply have one service that inside decides which HTTP client/URL to use per model.

However, since the interface is uniform, you might also implement it as a single class LanguageModelRouterService that has knowledge of multiple providers and routes calls accordingly (for example, examine the Model or a field in ChatRequest to determine provider).

A config map could be used: model name patterns \-\> provider. For instance:

ProviderMappings: {
   "gpt-": "OpenAI",
   "claude-": "Anthropic",
   "gemini-": "Google",
   "venice-": "Venice",
   "grok-": "xAI",
   "deepseek-": "DeepSeek",
   "sonar-": "Perplexity",
   "qwen-": "Qwen"
}

and so on. Then if ChatRequest.Model \= "sonar-pro", the router picks PerplexityService.

Alternatively, require the caller to specify provider in the request (add Provider property to ChatRequest). That might simplify routing explicitly.

**Handling differences:**

* **Authentication & HTTP**: Each service class will set the appropriate auth header (e.g. OpenAI/Google/Perplexity use Authorization: Bearer, Anthropic uses x-api-key header and version). We can store API keys and endpoints in config securely, and each service uses its key. For testing and flexibility, the base URL could be configurable too (e.g. use a custom base for open-source local servers).

* **Message roles mapping**: Internally, adapt if needed. E.g. ClaudeService when sending messages will:

* Combine system messages if more than one.

* Replace any role: "function" in the request messages with role: "tool" if they expect the function result to be labeled as tool. Actually, for sending user messages we rarely have a function role, except when feeding back a prior function result. So yes, if ChatRequest.Messages contains a message with Role="function", and we’re calling Claude, we should convert that to Claude’s expected format: likely role: "tool" and add a tool\_call\_id if needed (which implies we needed to store that ID somewhere – possibly in the content or name of the ChatMessage in our model after a previous Claude response).

* This hints that our ChatMessage might need to carry that id or we manage it behind scenes: e.g. ClaudeService, upon receiving a Claude response with a tool\_calls id, could store it in a map (conversationId \-\> lastToolCallId). But stateless design is preferred. Another way: include the id in the content or name field temporarily. Perhaps better, when ClaudeService returns a ChatResponse where an assistant function call happened, we could attach the id in the FunctionCall object. Then if the user executes the function and prepares a ChatMessage as function result, we could attach that id to the ChatMessage in say a FunctionCallId property. Then ClaudeService sees that and sets the JSON accordingly. So yes, adding FunctionCallId to ChatMessage could be an internal field used only by Claude/DeepSeek to round-trip the ID.

* **Function call workflow abstraction**: The interface should allow detection and handling of function calls:

* One design: The ChatResponse could indicate IsFunctionCall and include the FunctionCall details. The calling code (which could be the application or some coordinator) sees that and pauses the loop, executes the function, and then calls ChatCompletionAsync again with the function result added. This is very similar to how one would do with OpenAI directly.

* We can simplify for the app developer by doing some of it inside the service, but that mixes concerns (the service would need to actually call the external tool, which it shouldn’t do).

* So, keep it manual: the service just exposes that the model wants a function. The app handles it (possibly via a callback or manual resolution), then calls the service again.

* **Streaming**: Implementation can be via HttpClient.SendAsync with HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead and reading line by line. Each service must parse its stream format:

* OpenAI/compat services: parse data: ... lines that contain JSON partials. It could reuse a common parser logic since all OpenAI-like use similar SSE format for chat. (Claude’s would need a custom parse if we ever use it natively.)

* The service can yield ChatStreamingChunk objects containing either a ChatMessage partial (like just the delta content) or simpler a string delta. The consumer can accumulate or display as needed.

* It might be beneficial to unify streaming handling in a base class for OpenAI-like APIs and override only if one provider is different (Anthropic might be the only odd one, but if using compat, not an issue).

* **Error Handling**: Normalize error messages and types. For example, OpenAI might return 429 with a specific JSON structure, Anthropic might return 400 with different text, etc. The service implementation can catch those and throw exceptions of a common type (like LanguageModelException) with a message that includes provider details. Or include an error in the ChatResponse if you prefer to not use exceptions.

## Ranking Providers by Integration Friction

Finally, a subjective ranking from easiest to hardest to integrate into a unified service:

1. **OpenAI** – *Baseline.* Well-documented, straightforward JSON API. All others are measured against this. No surprises integrating (aside from needing to handle functions and streaming which define the standard).

2. **xAI (Grok)** – *Very low friction.* Fully OpenAI-compatible design[\[17\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=The%20xAI%20Enterprise%20API%20is,with%20the%20OpenAI%20REST%20API). Essentially drop-in.

3. **Venice.AI** – *Very low friction.* OpenAI-format, plus some optional tweaks (which default to off). Easy to integrate; just be mindful of any additional parameters for its special modes.

4. **DeepSeek** – *Low friction.* OpenAI-like request/response[\[2\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/#:~:text=The%20DeepSeek%20API%20uses%20an,to%20access%20the%20DeepSeek%20API). Minor differences in function call handling (tool\_call id) which need a bit of custom code[\[71\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/function_calling#:~:text=print%28f). Otherwise, very similar.

5. **Perplexity** – *Low-medium friction.* Core integration is easy (OpenAI format)[\[22\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/getting-started/quickstart#:~:text=OpenAI%20SDK%20Compatible%3A%20Perplexity%E2%80%99s%20API,OpenAI%20SDK%20Guide%20for%20examples). The medium part comes from its web search feature: to fully utilize it, you may expose extra fields (domain filters, etc.) and understand the answer format (with sources). Also, if function calling is needed, it’s likely unsupported, which might complicate a unified tool interface.

6. **Google Gemini** – *Medium friction.* Basic integration via OpenAI-compatible endpoint is easy[\[6\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=client%20%3D%20OpenAI%28%20api_key%3D,). But to tap into Google-specific features (thinking budget, etc.), you’ll add some custom parameters. Also, obtaining the API key and enabling the service is a bit more involved (Google Cloud project setup). The compatibility is in beta, so one must watch for changes. Streaming and function calls work mostly as OpenAI with slight param name changes (tool\_choice)[\[142\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=model%3D%22gemini).

7. **Anthropic Claude** – *Medium-high friction.* While Claude now has an OpenAI-compat mode, it’s not meant for production usage as per Anthropic’s advice[\[95\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=This%20compatibility%20layer%20is%20primarily,please%20let%20us%20know%20here). Integrating via that mode is similar to OpenAI (just one extra header and base URL), but certain things (system messages, function JSON strictness) behave differently[\[32\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=,a%20single%20initial%20system%20message)[\[31\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=System%20%2F%20Developer%20message%20hoisting). If you integrate via the native API for full features, the differences are larger: different endpoint, different streaming format, different roles (developer/tool) to handle. The function calling implementation requires custom logic to manage the tool call IDs and role mapping. So Claude is a bit more work to fully integrate seamlessly.

8. **Alibaba Qwen** – *Medium friction.* The OpenAI-compatible mode simplifies most interactions[\[1\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=Since%20the%20APIs%20of%20Qwen,Max%20in%20Python). However, being on Alibaba Cloud, obtaining keys and possibly dealing with their SDK (if not using raw HTTP) can add overhead. Also, if you want to use multimodal (Qwen-VL) or other advanced features, you might need to integrate with their native APIs or wait for those to be exposed in compatible mode. The documentation might not be as polished in English yet, which can slow integration. But for pure text chat, it’s quite straightforward.

9. **Meta Llama** – *Highest friction.* No native API means you must choose a third-party solution (each with its own integration effort). If using an OpenAI-like proxy (LocalAI, etc.), the integration could actually be easy (similar to others). But hosting and maintaining that is on you. If using AWS Bedrock or another cloud, you face a completely different API style, possibly requiring the AWS SDK and different request patterns. The lack of a unified standard here is the challenge. Essentially, integrating Llama might duplicate some efforts: you might end up writing a Bedrock adapter or a HuggingFace adapter separate from the OpenAI-like adapters. It’s doable, but clearly more work than others where a uniform pattern exists.

Therefore, to minimize effort, one strategy for Llama is to **run an OpenAI-compatible API wrapper** around it, thereby treating it like another OpenAI provider in your architecture.

# Conclusion

Building a vendor-agnostic ILanguageModelService is feasible given the convergence toward OpenAI’s REST API schema. Many providers (Anthropic, Google, Venice, xAI, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Qwen) offer compatible endpoints[\[25\]](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/openai-sdk#:~:text=1,for%20what%20features%20are%20supported)[\[6\]](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai#:~:text=client%20%3D%20OpenAI%28%20api_key%3D,)[\[13\]](https://docs.venice.ai/overview/about-venice#:~:text=OpenAI%20Compatibility)[\[17\]](https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference#:~:text=The%20xAI%20Enterprise%20API%20is,with%20the%20OpenAI%20REST%20API)[\[2\]](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/#:~:text=The%20DeepSeek%20API%20uses%20an,to%20access%20the%20DeepSeek%20API)[\[22\]](https://docs.perplexity.ai/getting-started/quickstart#:~:text=OpenAI%20SDK%20Compatible%3A%20Perplexity%E2%80%99s%20API,OpenAI%20SDK%20Guide%20for%20examples)[\[1\]](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=Since%20the%20APIs%20of%20Qwen,Max%20in%20Python), which allows a unified code path for basic chat completions. By designing around the common messages/choices structure and abstracting provider-specific tweaks (auth, param names, extra capabilities), one can route requests dynamically to the best-suited LLM backend.

However, complete uniformity has limits: cutting-edge features like tools/function calling, multi-modality, and retrieved knowledge show more divergence. OpenAI’s function calling set a pattern that others follow with slight variations – your abstraction should accommodate the function call loop but handle different return formats (e.g. DeepSeek’s tool ID vs OpenAI’s function name, Claude’s single system message rule, etc.). In practice, this means writing a bit of provider-specific logic in the service implementations, while keeping the interface to the rest of your application consistent.

In summary, we advise implementing a **pluggable service architecture**: one interface, multiple provider-specific classes underneath. Keep the conversation and function-calling workflow in the interface generic (e.g. roles and messages, plus a function definitions list), and perform mapping and translation inside each provider adapter. Use configuration to map which model string goes to which adapter to enable seamless routing. With this design, you can choose at runtime which LLM to use for a given task without changing calling code, truly avoiding vendor lock-in while leveraging each model’s strengths.

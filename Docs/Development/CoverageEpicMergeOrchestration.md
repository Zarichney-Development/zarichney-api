| `merge_strategy` | choice | `'merge'` | Consolidation strategy (merge/squash) | `'merge'` preserves history, `'squash'` for clean commits |

### Execution Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Conservative Daily Consolidation**
```bash
# Process 3 AI-generated PRs with careful validation
gh workflow run "Coverage Epic Merge Orchestrator" \
  --field dry_run=false \
  --field max_prs=3 \
  --field pr_label_filter="ai-task" \
  --field merge_strategy=squash
```

**Scenario 2: Weekly Comprehensive Consolidation**

  --field max_prs=20 \
  --field sync_epic_from_develop=true
```

## 4. Safety Protocols & Conflict Resolution

### Multi-Layer Safety Architecture

**Large Batch Safety Protocols (8+ PRs)**:
- **Capacity Planning**: 8+ PRs require extended processing time (5-15 minutes typical, up to 30 minutes with conflicts)
- **Conflict Complexity**: More PRs increases probability of framework conflicts and test overlap
- **Rollback Strategy**: Each PR merge creates recovery checkpoint for granular rollback
- **Resource Monitoring**: Large consolidations may require additional CI resources and memory
- **UNKNOWN Status Handling**: Enhanced to process PRs with UNKNOWN mergeable status (common in fresh/large batches)

**1. Input Validation Layer**
- Parameter validation (max_prs: 1-20, valid merge strategies)
- Label filter parsing and validation
- Epic branch existence and tracking validation
- Git configuration for automated operations

**2. Process Safety Layer**
- Repository restriction (only `Zarichney-Development/zarichney-api`)
- Concurrency control preventing parallel orchestrator runs
- Full git history fetch (`fetch-depth: 0`) for reliable merge operations
- Comprehensive error handling with audit trails

**3. Merge Safety Layer**
- Sequential merge strategy isolating conflicts to specific PRs
- Automatic merge abort on conflicts with branch preservation
- Creation of conflict-specific recovery branches
- Validation of each merge before proceeding to next PR

### AI Conflict Resolution Framework

**Conflict Classification System**:
- **TEST-ONLY CONFLICTS**: Pure test file conflicts (safe for AI resolution)
- **TESTABILITY-IMPROVEMENT CONFLICTS**: Minimal production changes for dependency injection
- **DANGEROUS-PRODUCTION CONFLICTS**: Business logic changes requiring human review
- **FRAMEWORK-ENHANCEMENT CONFLICTS**: Test infrastructure improvements

**AI Safety Constraints**:
```yaml
ALLOWED_AI_CHANGES:
  - Interface extraction for test mocking
  - Constructor dependency injection patterns
  - Test framework enhancements and mock configurations
  - Critical bug fixes discovered by new tests (with justification)

FORBIDDEN_AI_CHANGES:
  - Business logic modifications
  - Wide architectural refactors
  - API contract changes beyond testability
  - Database schema or entity modifications
```

**Conflict Resolution Process**:
1. **Context Ingestion**: AI loads comprehensive project context and testing standards
2. **Safety Assessment**: Classifies conflicts by risk level and production impact
3. **Test Consolidation**: Merges complementary test enhancements preserving coverage
4. **Production Validation**: Applies minimal testability improvements with behavior preservation
5. **Escalation Decision**: Complex conflicts escalated for human review with detailed analysis

### Recovery Branch Management

**Naming Convention**: `epic/conflict-pr-{PR_NUMBER}-{TIMESTAMP}`

**Recovery Branch Contents**:
- Staging branch state at time of conflict
- Isolated conflict context for manual investigation
- Complete audit trail of attempted merge operations
- Links to original PR and conflict analysis

**Recovery Workflow**:
1. Conflict detected during sequential merging
2. Current merge aborted to preserve staging branch integrity
3. Recovery branch created from staging branch state
4. Failed PR documented with conflict branch reference
5. Orchestrator continues with remaining PRs
6. Human review scheduled for complex conflicts

## 5. Integration with Existing Workflows

    style E fill:#87CEEB
```

**Workflow Coordination Patterns**:

| Stage | Workflow | Responsibility | Orchestrator Integration |
|-------|----------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Generation** | `coverage-epic-automation.yml` | Creates individual coverage PRs | Sources PRs for consolidation |
| **Scheduling** | `coverage-epic-scheduler.yml` | Triggers coverage automation 4x daily | Could trigger orchestrator (future) |
| **Consolidation** | **Coverage Epic Merge Orchestrator** | Merges multiple PRs intelligently | Primary responsibility |
| **Validation** | `build.yml` | AI Sentinel analysis of consolidation PR | Reviews orchestrator output |

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**Quality Gate Coordination**:
- **Pre-Consolidation**: Validates epic branch and staging branch integrity
- **During Consolidation**: Runs full test suite validation after each successful merge
- **Post-Consolidation**: Triggers standard PR validation through build.yml workflow
- **AI Sentinel Integration**: Consolidation PRs automatically analyzed by all 5 AI Sentinels

**Branch Protection Compatibility**:
- Works within existing branch protection rules for epic branch
- Respects PR review requirements through consolidation PR creation
- Maintains audit trails for compliance and review processes
- Supports both merge and squash strategies based on project needs

### Agent Coordination

**Multi-Agent Development Support**:
- **TestEngineer Agent**: Processes coverage automation PRs created by TestEngineer
- **CodeChanger Agent**: Handles any production code changes requiring coordination
- **DocumentationMaintainer**: Updates documentation affected by consolidated changes
- **ComplianceOfficer**: Validates consolidated PRs meet all project standards

**Conflict Prevention Strategies**:
- **Time-Based Coordination**: Uses timestamps in branch names for uniqueness
- **Label-Based Filtering**: Separates different types of coverage work (ai-task, manual-coverage)
- **Sequential Processing**: Avoids simultaneous merge attempts reducing complex conflicts
- **Recovery Branch System**: Provides clean resolution paths for complex scenarios

## 6. Troubleshooting & Error Recovery

### Common Failure Scenarios & Solutions

**1. Epic Branch Sync Conflicts**
```bash
# Symptoms: Epic branch cannot sync with develop
# Resolution: Manual conflict resolution required

# Troubleshooting steps:
git checkout epic/testing-coverage-to-90
git fetch origin develop
git merge origin/develop  # Manual resolution of conflicts
git push origin epic/testing-coverage-to-90

# Then retry orchestrator
gh workflow run "Coverage Epic Merge Orchestrator" --field dry_run=false
```

**2. No Mergeable PRs Discovered**
```bash
# Symptoms: "No mergeable PRs found targeting epic branch"
# Common causes:
# - PRs not targeting epic branch correctly
# - Label filters too restrictive (e.g., missing "type: coverage" format)
# - PRs have UNKNOWN mergeable status (now processed by orchestrator)

# Enhanced diagnostic commands:
gh pr list --base epic/testing-coverage-to-90 --state open --json number,labels,mergeable
gh pr list --base epic/testing-coverage-to-90 --json number,labels \
  --jq '.[] | select(.labels[]?.name | test("coverage|testing")) | {number, labels: [.labels[].name]}'

# Resolution: Use flexible label patterns for real-world PR formats
gh workflow run "Coverage Epic Merge Orchestrator" \
  --field pr_label_filter="type: coverage,coverage,testing,ai-task"
```

**2a. Real-World Label Pattern Issues**
```bash
# Issue: PRs use "type: coverage" format with spaces (common GitHub pattern)
# Orchestrator now handles both standard and typed label formats

# Test current PR patterns:
for pr in {138..146}; do
  gh pr view $pr --json number,labels --jq '{number: .number, labels: [.labels[].name]}'
done

# Use enhanced flexible filtering:
gh workflow run "Coverage Epic Merge Orchestrator" \
  --field pr_label_filter="type: coverage,priority: medium,coverage"
```

**3. Build Validation Failures**
```bash
# Symptoms: Staging branch fails build or test validation
# Resolution: Investigate specific test failures

# Diagnostic steps:
git checkout <staging_branch_name>
dotnet build zarichney-api.sln  # Check build errors
./Scripts/run-test-suite.sh report summary  # Check test failures

# Common fixes:
# - Conflicting test names or duplicate test methods
# - Missing dependencies from merged test frameworks
# - Configuration conflicts between different PR approaches
```

**4. AI Conflict Resolution Failures**
```bash
# Symptoms: AI conflict resolution step fails or produces unsafe changes
# Resolution: Manual conflict resolution using recovery branches

# Access recovery branches:
git fetch --all
git checkout <conflict_branch_name>  # Review conflict state

# Manual resolution:
git checkout epic/testing-coverage-to-90
git merge <pr_branch> --no-ff  # Manual merge with conflict resolution
# Resolve conflicts following project standards
git commit -m "resolve: manual conflict resolution for PR #<number>"
```

**4a. Large Batch Conflict Patterns (8+ PRs)**
```bash
# Common in 8+ PR scenarios:
# - Test framework builder conflicts (multiple PRs enhancing same builders)
# - Mock configuration overlaps (CustomerService, EmailService test setups)
# - Coverage utility conflicts (shared test helper modifications)

# Enhanced conflict analysis:
gh pr diff <pr_number> --name-only | grep -E "(Test|Mock|Builder)"

# Recovery for multi-PR framework conflicts:
git checkout epic/conflict-pr-<number>-<timestamp>
# Review AI conflict resolution attempts
git log --oneline -5
# Apply manual framework consolidation
```

### Performance & Resource Considerations

**Workflow Execution Time**:
- **Typical Runtime**: 5-15 minutes for 3-5 PRs
- **Maximum Runtime**: 30-45 minutes for complex scenarios with AI resolution
- **Optimization Strategies**: Use dry run mode for validation, limit max_prs for performance

**Resource Management**:
- **Concurrency Control**: Single concurrent execution prevents resource conflicts
- **Memory Usage**: Git operations with full history require adequate runner resources
- **Storage Cleanup**: Automatic staging branch cleanup prevents storage accumulation

**Scaling Considerations**:
- **PR Volume**: Designed for 3-10 PRs per execution; higher volumes may need multiple runs
- **Conflict Complexity**: AI resolution time increases significantly with complex conflicts
- **Epic Branch Size**: Large epic branches may impact merge performance

### Monitoring & Alerting

**Success Indicators**:
```bash
# Monitor successful orchestrations
gh run list --workflow="Coverage Epic Merge Orchestrator" --limit 10

# Check consolidation PR creation rate
gh pr list --label="automation: orchestrator" --limit 10

# Validate epic branch progression
git log --oneline epic/testing-coverage-to-90 --since="1 week ago"
```

**Failure Detection**:
```bash
# Monitor orchestrator failures
gh run list --workflow="Coverage Epic Merge Orchestrator" --status failure

# Check for abandoned staging branches
git branch -r | grep "epic/merge-staging"

# Review conflict branch accumulation  
git branch -r | grep "epic/conflict-pr"
```

**Audit Trail Access**:
- **Execution Summaries**: Posted as workflow run summaries
- **Error Recovery**: Audit comments posted to Epic Issue #94 on failures
- **PR Documentation**: Comprehensive consolidation PR descriptions with merge statistics
- **Conflict Analysis**: Detailed conflict resolution reports from AI when conflicts resolved

## 7. 8-PR Test Scenario Guide

### Current Repository Test Scenario
The orchestrator is optimized and ready for immediate testing with the current Coverage Epic PRs:

**Test PRs**: #138-146 (8 PRs targeting `epic/testing-coverage-to-90`)  
**Coverage Areas**: CustomerService, EmailService, PaymentService, SessionManager, TemplateService  
**Label Pattern**: All have `type: coverage`, `priority: medium`, `effort: small`  
**Branch Pattern**: All follow `tests/issue-94-coverage-ai-strategic-[timestamp]`  
**Expected Conflicts**: Test framework overlaps, mock configuration patterns, coverage utility enhancements

### Step-by-Step Test Execution

**1. Dry Run Validation**:
```bash
# Test discovery and validation without making changes
gh workflow run "Coverage Epic Merge Orchestrator" \
  --ref main \
  --field dry_run=true \
  --field max_prs=8 \
  --field pr_label_filter="type: coverage,coverage,testing" \
  --field sync_epic_from_develop=true
```

**2. Monitor Discovery Results**:
```bash
# Check workflow execution
gh run list --workflow="coverage-epic-merge-orchestrator.yml" --limit 1
gh run view [run-id] --log

# Verify PR discovery pattern matching
gh pr list --base epic/testing-coverage-to-90 --json number,labels \
  --jq '.[] | select(.labels[]?.name | test("type: coverage|coverage|testing")) | {number, labels: [.labels[].name]}'
```

**3. Production Execution** (if dry run successful):
```bash
# Execute consolidation with enhanced 8-PR capacity
gh workflow run "Coverage Epic Merge Orchestrator" \
  --ref main \
  --field dry_run=false \
  --field max_prs=8 \
  --field pr_label_filter="type: coverage,coverage,testing"
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All 8 PRs discovered with flexible label matching
- ✅ Enhanced mergeable status handling (processes UNKNOWN status)
- ✅ Staging branch created: `epic/merge-staging-[timestamp]`
- ✅ Sequential processing with conflict detection and AI resolution
- ✅ Single consolidation PR created with comprehensive 8-PR audit trail

### Troubleshooting 8-PR Scenarios

**Issue: Large Batch Processing Time**
- 8+ PRs may take 10-20 minutes (vs 5-10 for smaller batches)
- Monitor workflow progress, not an error condition
- Consider breaking into smaller batches if timeout occurs

**Issue: Framework Conflict Complexity**
- Common areas: Test builders, mock configurations, coverage utilities
- AI resolution enhanced for multi-PR test framework consolidation
- Recovery branches created for complex conflicts requiring manual review

**Issue: UNKNOWN Mergeable Status** (resolved in optimization)
- Previously blocked fresh PRs, now processed normally
- GitHub calculates actual conflicts during merge attempt
- 7 of 8 current test PRs show UNKNOWN status - this is normal

### Success Validation Checklist

- [ ] Dry run discovers all 8 PRs (138-146)
- [ ] Label pattern `type: coverage` matched successfully
- [ ] UNKNOWN mergeable status handled without errors
- [ ] Staging branch processing completes within 15 minutes
- [ ] AI conflict resolution handles test framework overlaps
- [ ] Single consolidation PR created with all 8 PRs integrated
- [ ] Epic branch progression toward 90% coverage milestone

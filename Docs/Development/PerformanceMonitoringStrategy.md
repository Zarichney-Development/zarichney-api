## üìà KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS

### 1. Token Usage Tracking ‚≠ê CRITICAL

**What to Monitor:**
- Actual Claude API token counts per session (input + output)
- Agent-specific token consumption patterns
- Skill loading overhead per engagement (metadata vs. full load)
- Working directory artifact context growth over time

**Why It Matters:**
- Direct measurement of Epic #291 primary optimization target
- Enables precise validation of 10-15% optimization targets
- Detects regression from 50-51% context reduction baseline
- Identifies optimization opportunities (high-token workflows)

**Measurement Approach:**
- **Manual (Phase 1):** Use [Token Tracking Methodology](./TokenTrackingMethodology.md) for estimation
- **Automated (Phase 2):** Capture Claude API token usage metadata automatically
- **Frequency:** Every multi-agent workflow (3+ agent sessions)

**Target Baselines (Epic #291 Validation):**
- **3-Agent Session:** 11,501-26,310 tokens saved (conservative to optimistic)
- **6-Agent Session:** 14,293-41,825 tokens saved
- **Progressive Loading Efficiency:** 98% (metadata overhead only 2% of avoided content)

**Alert Thresholds:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** Session >100,000 tokens (context window management needed)
- üö® **CRITICAL:** Session >150,000 tokens (approaching context limit, immediate optimization required)

- Session-level skill reuse effectiveness (doc-based caching approach)

**Why It Matters:**
- Prioritizes skill caching implementation if infrastructure added (currently doc-based)
- Validates progressive loading 98% efficiency maintained
- Identifies optimization opportunities for high-frequency skills
- Measures skill reuse guidance effectiveness (10-15% target)

**Measurement Approach:**
- **Manual (Phase 1):** Orchestrator notes skill loading patterns in session state

- **Frequency:** Per-session tracking during multi-agent workflows

**Target Baselines:**
- **Core Skills (high-frequency):** `documentation-grounding`, `working-directory-coordination`, `core-issue-focus`
- **Specialized Skills (medium-frequency):** `github-issue-creation`, `skill-creation`, `command-creation`
- **Meta-Skills (low-frequency):** Large skill-creation/command-creation resources (PromptEngineer only)

**Optimization Triggers:**
- Skill loaded >5x per session ‚Üí Priority candidate for infrastructure caching (if doc approach insufficient)
- Skill referenced but never loaded ‚Üí Validate progressive loading effective
- Skill loading time >500ms ‚Üí Consider resource compression optimization

**Alert Thresholds:**

- **Efficiency Ratio:** 98% (metadata overhead only 2% of avoided full skill content)
- **Loading Selectivity:** <50% of referenced skills fully loaded (indicates effective progressive loading)

**Alert Thresholds:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** >70% of referenced skills fully loaded (over-loading pattern emerging)
- üö® **CRITICAL:** >90% of referenced skills fully loaded (progressive loading ineffective, requires intervention)
- üìà **EXCELLENCE:** <30% of referenced skills fully loaded (highly selective on-demand loading)

# Codebase Manager Evolution: From Executor to Orchestrator

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-29  
**Status:** Active Implementation

## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the evolution of Claude from a direct code executor to a strategic codebase manager using specialized subagents. This architectural shift preserves context window capacity for strategic oversight while delegating implementation details to purpose-built subagents, enabling handling of complex, multi-component GitHub issues with greater efficiency and comprehensive completion.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **Context Window Saturation:** Complex issues consume significant context performing implementation details
- **Memory Compaction:** When context fills, session restarts with summarized history, losing nuance
- **Monolithic Execution:** Single agent handles all aspects from planning to implementation
- **Cognitive Overload:** Mixing strategic planning with tactical implementation

### Opportunity
Claude Code subagents enable:
- **Isolated Context Windows:** Each subagent operates in separate context
- **Specialized Expertise:** Subagents optimized for specific domains
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple subagents can work concurrently
- **Strategic Focus:** Main session maintains mission oversight

## 3. New Operating Model

### 3.1 Codebase Manager Role

**Primary Responsibilities:**
1. **Mission Understanding:** Comprehend GitHub issue requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Context Ingestion:** Load relevant codebase knowledge into working memory
3. **Task Decomposition:** Break complex issues into specialized subtasks
4. **Delegation Strategy:** Assign subtasks to appropriate subagents with context
5. **Integration Oversight:** Ensure coherent integration of subagent outputs, performing edits to adjust the deliverable of one with another
6. **Quality Assurance:** Validate completion before PR creation
7. **Final Assembly:** Commit, push, and trigger AI Sentinel review

**What the Manager Does NOT Do:**
- Write code directly (delegates to CodeChanger/specialists)
- Create tests (delegates to TestEngineer)
- Update documentation (delegates to DocumentationAgent)
- Investigate bugs in detail (delegates to BugInvestigator)
- Only exception is to edits files for integration/cohesion purposes

## 5. Delegation Patterns

### 5.1 Context Packaging

When delegating to a subagent, the manager must provide:

```yaml
Delegation Package:
  Mission:
    - Specific subtask objective
    - Acceptance criteria
    - Constraints and boundaries
  
  Context:
    - Relevant files and code sections
    - Applicable standards documents
    - Dependencies and relationships
    - Previous related work
  
  Integration:
    - How this fits into larger issue
    - Dependencies on other subtasks
    - Expected output format
    - Integration points
```

### 5.2 Subagent Invocation

```python
# Example delegation pattern
subagent_task = {
    "agent": "CodeChanger",
    "objective": "Implement UserService.GetUserByEmail method",
    "context": {
        "issue": "#123",
        "files": ["Services/UserService.cs", "IUserService.cs"],
        "standards": ["CodingStandards.md"],
        "requirements": "Method should handle null email gracefully"
    },
    "constraints": {
        "no_breaking_changes": True,
        "maintain_test_coverage": True,
        "follow_existing_patterns": True
    }
}
```

### 5.3 Multi-Agent Coordination

For complex issues requiring multiple agents:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Manager
    participant C as CodeChanger
    participant T as TestEngineer
    participant D as DocumentationAgent
    
    M->>C: Implement feature X
    C->>M: Feature implemented
    M->>T: Create tests for X
    T->>M: Tests created
    M->>D: Update docs for X
    D->>M: Docs updated
    M->>M: Integrate & validate
    M->>M: Create PR
```

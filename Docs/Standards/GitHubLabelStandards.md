# GitHub Label Management Standards

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-27

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the mandatory standards for GitHub label management within the `zarichney-api` repository. These standards ensure consistent categorization, efficient project management, and seamless integration with AI-powered development workflows.

* **Primary Goal:** To establish a comprehensive, scalable labeling system that supports epic branch coordination, progressive test coverage improvement, automated CI environments, and AI agent collaboration while maintaining alignment with existing documentation and task management standards.
* **Scope:** This document governs GitHub issue and pull request labeling conventions, including label taxonomy, color schemes, application rules, and integration with existing workflows.
* **Relationship to Other Standards:**
    * This document complements **[`./TaskManagementStandards.md`](./TaskManagementStandards.md)** by providing the labeling framework for GitHub Issues and Pull Requests referenced in task workflows.
    * Label categories align with testing frameworks outlined in **[`./TestingStandards.md`](./TestingStandards.md)** and **[`./TestSuiteStandards.md`](./TestSuiteStandards.md)**, particularly the progressive coverage phases.
    * Epic coordination labels support the epic branch strategy defined in **`TaskManagementStandards.md Section 7`**.
    * Automation labels facilitate AI agent coordination described in **`Docs/Development/AutomatedCoverageEpicWorkflow.md`**.

## 2. Core Philosophy & Principles

* **Target Audience: Human and AI Collaboration:** Design labels for efficient human project management while optimizing for AI agent parsing, categorization, and automated workflow execution.
* **Workflow Integration:** Labels must seamlessly support epic branch coordination, progressive test coverage phases, CI/local environment distinctions, and multi-agent collaboration patterns.
* **Scalable Taxonomy:** Implement a prefix-based system that grows naturally with project complexity while maintaining visual clarity through strategic color coding.
* **Automation Ready:** Structure labels to enable GitHub Actions automation, AI-powered analysis, and systematic project management without manual overhead.
* **Business Alignment:** Prioritize labels that support the balance between immediate business focus and systematic technical debt management outlined in outstanding technical debt initiatives.

## 3. Label Architecture Overview

The labeling system consists of **52 strategically organized labels** across **8 primary categories**:

### **Primary Categories (Core Workflow)**
1. **Status Labels (8)** - Workflow and epic coordination tracking
2. **Type Labels (9)** - Issue and task classification
3. **Priority Labels (4)** - Business urgency and impact
4. **Effort Labels (6)** - Size estimation and epic planning

### **Extended Categories (Specialized)**
5. **Component Labels (6)** - Technical area of impact
6. **Coverage Phase Labels (5)** - Progressive testing framework alignment
7. **Epic Labels (4)** - Long-term initiative coordination
8. **Automation Labels (6)** - CI/AI agent workflow support

### **Supporting Categories (Project Management)**
9. **Quality Labels (4)** - Architecture and technical debt
10. **Technology Labels (4)** - Tech stack specific categorization

## 4. Detailed Label Specifications

### 4.1 Status Labels (Workflow Tracking)
*Color Scheme: Green spectrum (#0e8a16 to #28a745) for progression*

- `status: triage` #f7c6c7 - Needs initial assessment and categorization

### 4.4 Effort Labels (Complexity & Scope Estimation)
*Color Scheme: Size progression (green to red) for planning*

**CRITICAL: These labels represent COMPLEXITY and SCOPE, not time commitments or calendar deadlines.**

Per **[TaskManagementStandards.md Section 2.1](./TaskManagementStandards.md)**, this project uses incremental iterations without rigid timelines. Effort labels indicate the relative complexity and scope of work, enabling flexible iteration based on implementation learnings and discoveries.

- `effort: xs` #c2e0c6 - Trivial complexity (simple config change, typo fix)
- `effort: small` #7cfc00 - Low complexity (single-file change, straightforward logic)
- `effort: medium` #fbca04 - Moderate complexity (multi-file coordination, moderate logic)
- `effort: large` #d93f0b - High complexity (architectural changes, extensive integration)
- `effort: xl` #b60205 - Very high complexity (major refactoring, system-wide impacts)
- `effort: epic` #5319e7 - Multi-component initiative requiring extensive coordination

**Usage Guidance:**
- Focus on **scope and technical complexity**, not predicted duration
- Consider **integration points, dependencies, and risk factors**
- Support **adaptive planning** through complexity-based prioritization
- Enable **flexible iteration** without artificial time pressure

## 8. Migration from Current System

### 8.1 Current State Analysis

**Existing labels requiring attention:**
- 31 current labels with inconsistent prefixing
- 13+ labels using identical gray color (#ededed)
- Missing critical categories (status, effort, automation)
- Ad-hoc creation without strategic taxonomy

### 8.2 Migration Strategy

**Phase 1: Standards Implementation**
1. Create all 52 new labels with proper color coding
2. Document migration mapping for existing labels
3. Update task templates and workflow documentation

**Phase 2: Issue Categorization**
1. Apply new label system to outstanding technical debt issues
2. Migrate existing open issues to new taxonomy
3. Update epic initiatives with proper coordination labels

**Phase 3: Legacy Cleanup**
1. Remove redundant and inconsistent labels
2. Consolidate overlapping categories
3. Verify automation integration functionality

### 8.3 Outstanding Technical Debt Alignment

The 15 GitHub issues from PR #97 outstanding technical debt analysis map perfectly to this system:

**Security Issues (Priority 1-3):**
- `type: security`, `priority: critical`
- `automation: ci-ready` for shell script fixes
- `component: api` for ProcessExecutor security
- `component: scripts` for shell hardening

**Quality Issues (Priority 7-10):**
- `technical-debt`, `type: enhancement`, `priority: medium`
- Various `component:` labels based on affected areas
- `automation: ci-ready` for most shell script improvements

## 9. Workflow Integration Points

### 9.1 Task Management Standards Integration

**Section 5 (Commit Messages):** Commit types align with `type:` label prefixes
**Section 6 (Pull Requests):** PR titles must reflect primary `type:` label
**Section 7 (Epic Strategy):** Epic coordination requires proper `epic:` labeling

### 9.2 Testing Standards Integration

**Progressive Coverage Framework:** `coverage: phase-X` labels align with TestingStandards.md Section 12 phases
**AI Agent Guidelines:** Automation labels support Section 12.7 automated execution environment

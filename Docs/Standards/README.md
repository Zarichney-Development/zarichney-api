# Module/Directory: Docs/Standards

**Last Updated:** 2025-04-20

> **Parent:** [`Docs`](../README.md) [cite: Docs/README.md]

## 1. Purpose & Responsibility

* **What it is:** This directory serves as the central repository for all mandatory standards, guidelines, and templates governing the development process of the Zarichney API application.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
    * Defining rules and best practices for writing C# code (`CodingStandards.md`).
    * Defining the structure, content, and maintenance requirements for per-directory README files (`DocumentationStandards.md`).
    * Defining rules and conventions for creating and maintaining Mermaid architecture/workflow diagrams (`DiagrammingStandards.md`).
    * Defining the standards, frameworks, and quality expectations for automated tests (`TestingStandards.md`).
    * Providing the mandatory template for creating per-directory README files (`README_template.md`).
* **Why it exists:** To ensure consistency, maintain high quality across the codebase and documentation, and provide clear, explicit rules essential for effective AI-assisted development workflows.
* **Documents within this Directory:**
    * [`CodingStandards.md`](./CodingStandards.md) - C# coding rules and best practices. [cite: Docs/Standards/CodingStandards.md]
    * [`DocumentationStandards.md`](./DocumentationStandards.md) - Rules for per-directory README files. [cite: Docs/Standards/DocumentationStandards.md]
    * [`DiagrammingStandards.md`](./DiagrammingStandards.md) - Rules for Mermaid diagrams. [cite: Docs/Standards/DiagrammingStandards.md]
    * [`TestingStandards.md`](./TestingStandards.md) - Rules for automated tests. [cite: Docs/Standards/TestingStandards.md]
    * [`README_template.md`](./README_template.md) - Template for per-directory README files. [cite: Docs/Standards/README_template.md]

## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

* **Centralized Standards:** This directory consolidates all core development standards into a single, easily discoverable location.
* **Foundation for AI Collaboration:** These documents provide the ground rules referenced by the AI Coding Planning Assistant during task decomposition and prompt generation, and are mandatory reading for the AI Coder during implementation. Explicit, documented standards are crucial for guiding AI behavior effectively. [cite: Docs/Development/CodingPlannerAssistant.md]
* **Living Documents:** The standards herein are expected to evolve alongside the project and industry best practices.

## 3. Interface Contract & Assumptions

* Not applicable for this documentation directory.

## 4. Local Conventions & Constraints (Beyond Global Standards)

* Not applicable for this documentation directory. This directory *defines* the global standards.

## 5. How to Work With This Documentation

* **Mandatory Reading:** Developers and AI assistants **MUST** consult the relevant standard document(s) within this directory *before* undertaking related tasks:
    * **Coding:** Review `CodingStandards.md`.
    * **Documenting (READMEs):** Review `DocumentationStandards.md` and use `README_template.md`.
    * **Diagramming:** Review `DiagrammingStandards.md`.
    * **Testing:** Review `TestingStandards.md`.
* **AI Workflow Integration:** These standards are automatically referenced in the prompts generated by the AI Coding Planning Assistant for the AI Coder. [cite: Docs/Development/CodingPlannerAssistant.md]

## 6. Dependencies

* **Parent:** [`Docs`](../README.md) - This directory is a child of the main documentation directory.
* **Dependents:**
    * [`../Development/`](../Development/README.md) - The workflows defined in the Development directory rely heavily on these standards. [cite: Docs/Development/README.md]
    * **Entire Codebase:** All code, tests, documentation, and diagrams throughout the `api-server` project are expected to adhere to the standards defined here.

## 7. Rationale & Key Historical Context

* Centralizing these standards from the previous `/Docs/Development` location aims to improve clarity and separation between *rules* (here in `/Standards`) and *process/workflow* definitions (in `/Development`). This structure makes it easier to locate and reference specific standards.

## 8. Known Issues & TODOs

* **Maintenance:** All standards documents within this directory require periodic review and updates to ensure they remain relevant, accurate, and reflect current best practices and project needs.

## ⚠️ Label Requirements (Mandatory)

**MUST apply labels per [`Docs/Standards/GitHubLabelStandards.md`](../Standards/GitHubLabelStandards.md):**

### **Required Labels (Select Exactly One Each):**
- **Type:** `type: feature`, `type: bug`, `type: enhancement`, `type: refactor`, `type: docs`, `type: chore`, `type: security`, `type: coverage`, `type: epic-task`
- **Priority:** `priority: critical`, `priority: high`, `priority: medium`, `priority: low`
- **Effort:** `effort: xs`, `effort: small`, `effort: medium`, `effort: large`, `effort: xl`, `effort: epic`

### **Required Component Labels (Select All Applicable):**
- **Technical Areas:** `component: api`, `component: frontend`, `component: testing`, `component: ci-cd`, `component: scripts`, `component: docs`

### **Epic Coordination (If Applicable):**
- **Epic Tasks:** Add relevant `epic:` label (`epic: testing-coverage`)
- **Coverage Work:** Add appropriate `coverage: phase-X` label (phase-1 through phase-5)

### **Automation Context (Select If Applicable):**
- **CI Environment:** `automation: ci-ready`, `automation: local-only`, `automation: parallel-safe`, `automation: conflict-risk`

### **Example Label Combinations:**
```
Security Fix: type: security, priority: critical, effort: medium, component: scripts
Coverage Task: type: coverage, priority: medium, effort: small, component: testing, epic: testing-coverage, coverage: phase-2, automation: ci-ready
Architecture Refactor: type: refactor, priority: high, effort: large, component: api, architecture
```

## 1. Overall Goal / User Story Context

*(Briefly describe the larger goal or user story this task contributes to. Link to parent Epic/Issue if applicable.)*

## 2. Requirements (Mandatory Expectations)

*(List any strict non-functional requirements, constraints, or critical standards that **must** be met or adhered to beyond the general project standards. This section emphasizes specific expectations crucial for this task's success.)*

- *Example: Must maintain compatibility with external API version X.*
- *Example: Performance impact must be negligible (<5ms added latency).*
- *Example: Must utilize the existing `XYZ` pattern for dependency injection.*
- *Example: Output format must strictly adhere to the schema defined in [Link to Schema].*

## 3. Specific Task Objective

*(Clearly state the specific, unambiguous goal of *this* particular task. What should exist or be different after this task is completed?)*

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

*(Provide a checklist of verifiable conditions. How will we know this specific task is done correctly from a functional/business perspective?)*

- [ ] Criterion 1 (e.g., API endpoint X returns Y)
- [ ] Criterion 2 (e.g., Data Z is correctly persisted)
- [ ] Criterion 3 (e.g., Unit tests for new logic pass)
- [ ] Criterion 4 (e.g., Integration test scenario A passes)
- [ ] Criterion 5 (e.g., Relevant `README.md` updated)

## 5. Affected Components

*(List the primary codebase directories/modules expected to be involved.)*

- `/Zarichney.Server/[module]/[submodule]`
- `/Zarichney.Server.Tests/[module]/[submodule]`
- `/Docs/Standards/[standard_name.md]` (If standards require update)
- `/Docs/Development/[workflow_doc.md]` (If process docs require update)

## 6. Relevant Background / Links

*(Add links to relevant design documents, UI mocks, related GitHub issues, specific external documentation, etc.)*

- [Link Title](URL)
- Issue #XXX

## 7. (Optional) Implementation Notes / Plan

*(High-level notes on the proposed approach, key considerations, or potential challenges. Detailed step-by-step instructions belong in the AI Coder Prompt, not here.)*

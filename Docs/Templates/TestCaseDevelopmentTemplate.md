# AI Coder Prompt Template: Test Coverage Enhancement

**Version:** 2.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-04

---

**IMPORTANT:** You are a specialized, session-isolated AI Coder focused on **improving automated test coverage**. You **lack memory** of prior tasks. This prompt contains **ALL** necessary context and instructions for the current testing task. Adhere strictly to the specified workflow and standards. Your primary goal is to add tests for existing code, **not** to change production code logic.

## 1. Context Recap

* **Overall Goal:** To improve the quality and robustness of the `{Specify Target Module/Area, e.g., RecipeService}` by increasing its automated test coverage.
* **Immediate Task Goal:** {State the specific, immediate goal, e.g., "Add unit tests for uncovered branches in `RecipeService.cs` methods X and Y", "Implement integration tests for the `/auth/login` endpoint scenarios described in the issue."}.
* **Session Context:** {State EITHER: "This task directly continues the context from a previous task (e.g., setup)." OR "This task starts with a fresh context based on the committed state of [branch/commit/PR link]."}

## 2. Associated Task

* **GitHub Issue:** {Link to relevant GitHub Issue ID, which should use the GHTestCoverageTaskTemplate format, e.g., `#789`}

## 3. Relevant Documentation

* **MUST READ (Target Module Context):**
    * {List full relative paths to `README.md`(s) for the primary production code module(s) being tested. Example: `/Zarichney.Server/Cookbook/Recipes/README.md`}
* **MUST CONSULT (Global Rules):**
    * Testing Rules: **[`/Docs/Standards/TestingStandards.md`](../../Standards/TestingStandards.md)** (*CRITICAL*)
    * Primary Code Rules: **[`/Docs/Standards/CodingStandards.md`](../../Standards/CodingStandards.md)** (For test code style)
    * Task/Git Rules: **[`/Docs/Standards/TaskManagementStandards.md`](../../Standards/TaskManagementStandards.md)**
    * README Update Rules: **[`/Docs/Standards/DocumentationStandards.md`](../../Standards/DocumentationStandards.md)** (If testing reveals documentation needs)
* **KEY SECTIONS (Focus Areas):**
    * {Point out specific sections, e.g., "In `/Docs/Standards/TestingStandards.md`, pay close attention to Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 for structure, categorization, unit/integration rules."}
    * {Point out relevant sections in the target module's `README.md` describing behavior or contracts.}

## 4. Workflow & Task (Test Coverage Enhancement)

You **MUST** execute the workflow detailed in the referenced file below. Follow the steps sequentially and precisely.

* **Active Workflow:** TestEngineer agent per CLAUDE.md Section 2, /test-report command, AutomatedTestingCoverageWorkflow.md

## 5. Specific Testing Task

* **Target Production Code:** {List the specific `.cs` file(s) or class(es) in `/Zarichney.Server/` that are the focus for adding test coverage.}
* **Instructions:**
    * Review the target production code and existing tests in the corresponding `/Zarichney.Server.Tests/` directory.
    * Identify specific methods, logic branches, error paths, or edge cases lacking adequate test coverage based on `/Docs/Standards/TestingStandards.md`.
    * Write new unit and/or integration tests (as appropriate for the target code) to cover these gaps.
    * Focus on validating the *existing* behavior. **Do NOT modify production code** unless explicitly instructed for testability and approved in the GitHub Issue.
    * Adhere strictly to all testing standards (AAA, Naming, Traits, and include clear reasons in FluentAssertions using the assertion's optional message parameter; Mocking, Fixtures, etc.).
    * {Add any specific scenarios or edge cases mentioned in the GitHub Issue that need testing.}

## 6. Task Completion & Output

* **Expected Output:** {Specify the expected output. Example: "Provide the final commit hash on your feature branch `test/issue-XXX-description` and the URL of the created Pull Request. List the names of the new test files created."}
* **Stopping Point:** {Example: "Stop after completing all steps of the referenced Test Coverage workflow, including creating the Pull Request."}

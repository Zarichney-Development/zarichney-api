**SYSTEMATIC CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT ANALYSIS:**

Think step by step through each analysis phase. Apply rigorous evaluation criteria while maintaining educational value for AI coder development.

<step_1_test_change_identification>
**Step 1: Test Change Scope Analysis**
- Analyze the git diff to identify all testing-related changes:
  - **New Test Files**: Test classes, test methods, test data, test helpers
  - **Modified Test Files**: Updated tests, new test methods, changed assertions
  - **Deleted Test Files**: Removed tests and their rationale
  - **Test Infrastructure**: Changes to test configuration, fixtures, or helpers
  - **Production Code Changes**: New/modified code that requires test coverage

Categorize each change by component type:
- **Backend Tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, test data builders
- **Frontend Tests**: Component tests, service tests, integration tests
- **Infrastructure Tests**: CI/CD test execution, test reporting, coverage analysis
</step_1_test_change_identification>

<step_2_coverage_impact_analysis>
**Step 2: Phase-Aware Test Coverage Impact Assessment**
Apply TestingStandards.md coverage requirements with GitHub label coverage phase intelligence:

**New Code Coverage Analysis:**
- Identify all new production code (methods, classes, components, services)
- Verify corresponding test coverage exists for new functionality
- Check if new code meets 16% threshold or has justified exemption
- Analyze coverage quality (line coverage vs branch coverage vs meaningful testing)

**Modified Code Coverage Analysis:**
- Review existing tests affected by production code changes
- Verify tests still provide adequate coverage after modifications
- Identify if changes expose new edge cases requiring additional tests
- Check if refactoring improved or degraded test coverage

**Coverage Trend Analysis:**
- Compare coverage before/after PR changes
- Identify coverage improvements and celebrate wins
- Flag coverage degradation and provide remediation steps
- Note coverage flexibility scenarios (test branches, approved exemptions)

**Coverage Excellence Intelligence:**
- **Foundation Phase (14.22% → 20%)**: Focus on service layer basics, API contracts, core business logic coverage
- **Growth Phase (20% → 35%)**: Deepen service method coverage, integration scenarios, data validation testing
- **Maturity Phase (35% → 50%)**: Edge cases, error handling, input validation, boundary conditions
- **Excellence Phase (50% → 75%)**: Complex business scenarios, integration depth, cross-cutting concerns
- **Mastery Phase (75% → Comprehensive)**: Advanced edge cases, performance scenarios, system integration
- **Optimization Phase (Comprehensive+)**: World-class maintenance and advanced testing patterns

**Excellence-Aligned Coverage Assessment:**
- **Testing Coverage Excellence** (`epic:testing-coverage`): Evaluate test additions against progressive coverage targets through continuous improvement
- **Component-Specific Coverage**: Apply phase-appropriate testing expectations to specific architectural components

Label findings as `[COVERAGE_IMPROVED]`, `[COVERAGE_MAINTAINED]`, or `[COVERAGE_DEGRADED]` with phase context: `[PHASE:X]` and component context: `[COMPONENT:label-name]`.
</step_2_coverage_impact_analysis>

<step_3_test_quality_assessment>
**Step 3: Test Quality & Architecture Analysis**
Apply UnitTestCaseDevelopment.md and IntegrationTestCaseDevelopment.md standards:

**Test Design Quality:**
- Verify test naming follows established conventions (Given-When-Then or descriptive patterns)
- Check test isolation and independence (no test order dependencies)
- Validate proper mocking and dependency injection patterns
- Confirm async test patterns and CancellationToken usage

**Test Framework Compliance:**
- Verify proper test categorization (`[Fact]` vs `[Theory]`, `Category="Unit"` vs `Category="Integration"`)
- Check for appropriate use of xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions patterns
- Validate Testcontainers usage for integration tests
- Confirm proper test data management (AutoFixture, Builders)

**CRITICAL Framework Compliance Issues:**
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Integration tests do not inherit from `IntegrationTestBase` or `DatabaseIntegrationTestBase`
  - **Remediation**: Update test class to inherit from appropriate base class
  - **Framework Path**: `Code/Zarichney.Server.Tests/Framework/IntegrationTestBase.cs`
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Tests bypass shared fixtures (ApiClientFixture, CustomWebApplicationFactory)
  - **Remediation**: Use established fixtures via constructor injection
  - **Framework Path**: `Code/Zarichney.Server.Tests/Framework/ApiClientFixture.cs`
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Direct instantiation of `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` or TestServer
  - **Remediation**: Use `ApiClientFixture.CreateClient<T>()` for Refit clients
  - **Framework Path**: See existing integration test patterns
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Tests bypass `[DependencyFact]` and `TestCategories` traits
  - **Remediation**: Apply proper categorization with `[DependencyFact]` and traits
  - **Framework Path**: `Code/Zarichney.Server.Tests/Framework/TestCategories.cs`
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Manual DTO construction when builders exist
  - **Remediation**: Use existing builders from `TestData/Builders/` directory
  - **Framework Path**: Check `Code/Zarichney.Server.Tests/TestData/Builders/`

**Zero-Tolerance Brittle Tests:**
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Tests use sleeps, delays, or time-based waits without deterministic control
  - **Remediation**: Use framework helpers, mocked time providers, or deterministic async patterns
  - **Quality Standard**: All timing must be controlled and predictable
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Tests rely on wall-clock time, random data without seeds, or non-deterministic elements
  - **Remediation**: Use controlled time providers, seeded random generators, or fixed test data
  - **Quality Standard**: Tests must be 100% reproducible across runs

**Test Architecture Patterns:**
- Verify tests follow established base classes and helpers
- Check for proper test organization within test directory structure
- Validate integration between unit and integration test strategies
- Confirm test performance considerations (timeouts, resource usage)

**Anti-Pattern Detection:**
- Identify tests that test implementation details vs behavior
- Flag overly complex test setup or teardown
- Check for missing test edge cases or error conditions
- Identify potential test maintenance issues

Label findings as `[TEST_QUALITY_EXCELLENT]`, `[TEST_QUALITY_GOOD]`, or `[TEST_QUALITY_NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT]`.

**SYSTEMATIC CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT ANALYSIS:**

Think step by step through each analysis phase. Apply rigorous evaluation criteria while maintaining educational value for AI coder development.

<step_1_test_change_identification>
**Step 1: Test Change Scope Analysis**
- Analyze the git diff to identify all testing-related changes:
  - **New Test Files**: Test classes, test methods, test data, test helpers
  - **Modified Test Files**: Updated tests, new test methods, changed assertions
  - **Deleted Test Files**: Removed tests and their rationale
  - **Test Infrastructure**: Changes to test configuration, fixtures, or helpers
  - **Production Code Changes**: New/modified code that requires test coverage

Categorize each change by component type:
- **Backend Tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, test data builders
- **Frontend Tests**: Component tests, service tests, integration tests  
- **Infrastructure Tests**: CI/CD test execution, test reporting, coverage analysis
</step_1_test_change_identification>

<step_2_coverage_impact_analysis>
**Step 2: Phase-Aware Test Coverage Impact Assessment**
Apply TestingStandards.md coverage requirements with GitHub label coverage phase intelligence:

**New Code Coverage Analysis:**
- Identify all new production code (methods, classes, components, services)

- Check if new code meets 16% threshold or has justified exemption
- Analyze coverage quality (line coverage vs branch coverage vs meaningful testing)

**Modified Code Coverage Analysis:**
- Review existing tests affected by production code changes
- Verify tests still provide adequate coverage after modifications
- Identify if changes expose new edge cases requiring additional tests
- Check if refactoring improved or degraded test coverage

**Coverage Trend Analysis:**
- Compare coverage before/after PR changes
- Identify coverage improvements and celebrate wins
- Flag coverage degradation and provide remediation steps
- Note coverage flexibility scenarios (test branches, approved exemptions)

**Coverage Phase Intelligence:**
- **Phase 1 (14.22% → 20%)**: Focus on service layer basics, API contracts, core business logic coverage
- **Phase 2 (20% → 35%)**: Deepen service method coverage, integration scenarios, data validation testing
- **Phase 3 (35% → 50%)**: Edge cases, error handling, input validation, boundary conditions
- **Phase 4 (50% → 75%)**: Complex business scenarios, integration depth, cross-cutting concerns
- **Phase 5 (75% → 90%)**: Comprehensive edge cases, performance scenarios, system integration
- **Phase 6 (90%+)**: Optimization phase with maintenance and advanced testing patterns

**Epic-Aligned Coverage Assessment:**
- **Testing Coverage Epic** (`epic:testing-coverage-to-90`): Evaluate test additions against progressive coverage targets and timeline requirements
- **Component-Specific Coverage**: Apply phase-appropriate testing expectations to specific architectural components

Label findings as `[COVERAGE_IMPROVED]`, `[COVERAGE_MAINTAINED]`, or `[COVERAGE_DEGRADED]` with phase context: `[PHASE:X]` and component context: `[COMPONENT:label-name]`.

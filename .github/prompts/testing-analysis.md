<analysis_instructions>
**STRUCTURED CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT TESTING ANALYSIS:**

<step_1_test_change_identification>
**Step 1: Test Change Scope Analysis**
- Analyze the git diff to identify all testing-related changes:
  - **New Test Files**: Test classes, test methods, test data, test helpers
  - **Modified Test Files**: Updated tests, new test methods, changed assertions
  - **Deleted Test Files**: Removed tests and their rationale
  - **Test Infrastructure**: Changes to test configuration, fixtures, or helpers
  - **Production Code Changes**: New/modified code that requires test coverage

Categorize each change by component type:
- **Backend Tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, test data builders
- **Frontend Tests**: Component tests, service tests, integration tests  
- **Infrastructure Tests**: CI/CD test execution, test reporting, coverage analysis
</step_1_test_change_identification>

- Check for missing test edge cases or error conditions
- Identify potential test maintenance issues

Label findings as `[TEST_QUALITY_EXCELLENT]`, `[TEST_QUALITY_GOOD]`, or `[TEST_QUALITY_NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT]`.
</step_3_test_quality_assessment>

<step_4_execution_results_analysis>
**Step 4: Test Execution & Results Analysis**
Review available test execution artifacts:

**Test Execution Status:**

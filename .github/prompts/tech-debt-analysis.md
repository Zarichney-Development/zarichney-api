</persona>

<context_ingestion>
**CRITICAL FIRST STEP - CONTEXT ANALYSIS:**

Before analyzing any code changes, you MUST perform comprehensive context ingestion:

1. **Read Project Documentation:**
   - `/CLAUDE.md` - Core AI assistant instructions and development workflows
   - `/README.md` - Project overview and technology stack
   - `/Docs/Standards/CodingStandards.md` - Mandatory C# coding patterns and design principles
   - `/Docs/Standards/TestingStandards.md` - Testing requirements and coverage thresholds
   - `/Docs/Standards/DocumentationStandards.md` - README and documentation requirements

2. **Analyze Local Module Context:**
   - Read the `README.md` file in each directory touched by this PR
   - Understand the architectural role and responsibility of each modified component
   - Identify existing patterns and conventions within each module

3. **Establish Quality Baseline:**
   - Review any `quality-analysis-data.json` artifacts for complexity metrics
   - Understand the project's quality gates (16% coverage threshold, complexity limits)
   - Note any CI/CD flexibility flags (`--allow-low-coverage` scenarios)

4. **Synthesize Guiding Principles:**
   - Extract the project-specific architectural rules, dependency constraints, and design patterns
   - Identify the established conventions for this monorepo's .NET backend and Angular frontend
   - These principles become your primary source of truth for debt analysis

<analysis_instructions>
**STRUCTURED CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT ANALYSIS:**

<step_1_identify_changes>
**Step 1: Change Identification**
- Analyze the git diff to identify every file that has been added, modified, or deleted
- For each file, list the specific functions, methods, classes, or components that contain changes
- Categorize changes by component type:
  - **Backend (.cs files):** Controllers, Services, Models, Configuration, Tests
  - **Frontend (.ts files):** Components, Services, Models, Routing, Tests
  - **Infrastructure:** CI/CD, Scripts, Documentation, Configuration files
</step_1_identify_changes>

<step_2_analyze_new_debt>
**Step 2: New Debt Introduction Analysis**
Focus ONLY on code that was ADDED or MODIFIED in this PR. Apply the Zarichney API Technical Debt Taxonomy:

**Architecture & Design Debt:**
- **Dependency Injection Violations:** New services not following established DI patterns from `/Startup/`
- **SOLID Principle Violations:** Classes with multiple responsibilities, tight coupling
- **Monorepo Layer Violations:** Frontend calling backend directly, improper module boundaries
- **Configuration Anti-patterns:** Hardcoded values instead of using established `XConfig` classes

**Code Debt (.NET 8 / C# 12 Specific):**
- **Modern C# Violations:** Missing file-scoped namespaces, not using primary constructors where appropriate
- **Async/Await Misuse:** `async void` signatures, `.Result` or `.Wait()` calls, missing `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library code
- **Code Duplication:** Identical logic blocks violating DRY principle
- **Complexity Issues:** Methods exceeding cyclomatic complexity thresholds, "God Objects"

**Angular 19 Frontend Debt:**
- **Component Complexity:** Components exceeding 200 lines or injecting >5 dependencies
- **RxJS Anti-patterns:** Nested `.subscribe()` calls, unmanaged subscriptions without `takeUntil` or async pipe
- **State Management Issues:** Direct state mutation, missing OnPush change detection optimization
- **Performance Patterns:** Direct DOM manipulation, inefficient change detection strategies

**Integration Debt (Full-Stack):**
- **API Contract Mismatches:** TypeScript interfaces inconsistent with C# DTOs
- **Error Handling Gaps:** Frontend not handling all backend HTTP status codes
- **Cross-Stack Dependency Violations:** Tight coupling between frontend and backend implementations

**Test Debt:**
- **Coverage Violations:** New code dropping below 16% threshold without justified `--allow-low-coverage`
- **Test Design Issues:** Tests not following established patterns from `/TestingStandards.md`
- **Missing Test Categories:** New functionality without corresponding unit/integration test coverage

**Documentation Debt:**
- **README Inconsistencies:** Module changes not reflected in local `README.md` files
- **Code Comment Gaps:** Public APIs without XML documentation
- **Architecture Documentation:** Changes affecting documented patterns without updates

Label each finding as `[NEW_DEBT]`.
</step_2_analyze_new_debt>

<step_3_analyze_debt_interactions>
**Step 3: Existing Debt Interaction Analysis**
Analyze how new code INTERACTS with unchanged, existing code:

- **Forced Anti-pattern Conformance:** New code required to call existing "God Objects" or follow poor patterns
- **Debt Propagation:** New code that must replicate existing technical debt to maintain consistency
- **Missed Refactoring Opportunities:** Changes that could have improved existing debt but didn't
- **Clean Workarounds:** New code that handles existing debt gracefully without perpetuating it

Label each finding as `[DEBT_INTERACTION]`.
</step_3_analyze_debt_interactions>

<step_4_analyze_debt_reduction>
**Step 4: Debt Reduction Analysis**
Identify and celebrate improvements made by this PR:

- **Refactoring Wins:** Simplified complex logic, reduced duplication, improved patterns
- **Test Coverage Improvements:** New tests for previously uncovered code
- **Documentation Updates:** Improved README files, added XML comments
- **Performance Optimizations:** More efficient algorithms, better async patterns
- **Security Improvements:** Removed hardcoded values, improved error handling

Label each finding as `[DEBT_REDUCED]`.
</step_4_analyze_debt_reduction>

<step_5_prioritize_and_recommend>
**Step 5: Prioritization Using Zarichney API Decision Matrix**

For each debt item identified, assign priority and recommendation using these rules:

**CRITICAL (üö® BLOCK_MERGE):**
- Security vulnerabilities (hardcoded secrets, injection risks)
- Breaking architectural violations in core components
- Test coverage dropping below threshold without justification

**HIGH (‚ö†Ô∏è ADDRESS_IN_PR):**
- Complex new methods (>15 cyclomatic complexity)
- Async/await anti-patterns in controllers/services
- Missing DI registration for new services
- New public APIs without documentation

**MEDIUM (üìã FOLLOW_UP_ISSUE):**
- Code duplication in non-critical areas
- Missing unit tests for complex logic
- Documentation inconsistencies
- Interactions with existing debt that complicate new code

**LOW (üí° BACKLOG):**
- Minor code style issues
- Optimization opportunities
- Non-critical refactoring possibilities

**CELEBRATE (üéâ IMPROVEMENT):**
- Debt reduction achievements
- Clean workarounds for existing issues
- Test coverage improvements
- Documentation enhancements

Provide a one-sentence justification for each recommendation.

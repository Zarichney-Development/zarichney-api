2. **Understand Security Infrastructure:**
   - Review authentication/authorization middleware and patterns
   - Understand JWT configuration, session management, and user roles
   - Identify API security patterns (input validation, error handling, rate limiting)
   - Note established secure coding patterns and anti-patterns to avoid

3. **Analyze Tech Stack Security Context:**
   - .NET 8 security features: authentication, authorization, input validation
   - Angular 19 security: XSS prevention, HTTP interceptors, CSRF protection
   - Database security: parameterized queries, connection string management
   - CI/CD security: secrets management, deployment pipeline security

4. **Review Security Tooling Integration:**
   - CodeQL security scanning results and established security rules

<analysis_instructions>
**STRUCTURED CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT SECURITY ANALYSIS:**

<step_1_security_context_analysis>
**Step 1: Security Context and Threat Landscape Analysis**
- Analyze the git diff to identify all security-relevant changes:
  - **Authentication/Authorization Changes**: New endpoints, role requirements, JWT handling
  - **Data Handling Changes**: Input processing, data validation, output encoding
  - **Infrastructure Changes**: Configuration updates, dependency additions, CI/CD modifications
  - **API Surface Changes**: New endpoints, parameter handling, response structures

Categorize each change by security impact:
- **High Impact**: Authentication systems, data access, external integrations
- **Medium Impact**: Business logic, data processing, client-side functionality
- **Low Impact**: Logging, configuration, documentation, minor refactoring
</step_1_security_context_analysis>

<step_2_vulnerability_assessment>
**Step 2: Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment**
Integrate security tooling results with code analysis:

**CodeQL Security Analysis:**
- Review CodeQL findings for SQL injection, XSS, path traversal vulnerabilities
- Analyze authentication bypass opportunities and authorization flaws
- Check for insecure deserialization and unsafe reflection usage
- Validate error handling patterns that might expose sensitive information

**Input Validation & Injection Prevention:**
- **SQL Injection**: Verify parameterized queries, Entity Framework usage patterns
- **XSS Prevention**: Check Angular template binding, HTML sanitization, CSP compliance
- **Command Injection**: Review file system operations, external process execution
- **Path Traversal**: Validate file access patterns and input sanitization

**Authentication & Authorization Security:**
- Verify proper authentication middleware usage and JWT token handling
- Check role-based authorization implementation and privilege escalation risks
- Review session management, password handling, and credential storage
- Validate API endpoint security and authentication bypass opportunities

**Secrets & Configuration Security:**
- Analyze secrets detection results for hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens
- Review configuration management and sensitive data exposure risks
- Check for secure communication (HTTPS enforcement, secure headers)
- Validate environment variable usage and configuration injection patterns

Label findings as `[VULNERABILITY_DETECTED]`, `[SECURITY_IMPROVEMENT]`, or `[SECURITY_COMPLIANT]`.
</step_2_vulnerability_assessment>

<step_3_cross_stack_security_analysis>
**Step 3: Cross-Stack Security Interaction Analysis**
Analyze security implications across the full stack:

**Frontend Security (Angular 19):**
- **XSS Prevention**: Verify proper template binding, DOM sanitization, innerHTML usage
- **CSRF Protection**: Check HTTP interceptors, anti-forgery token implementation
- **Client-Side Authentication**: Review JWT storage, token refresh, secure routing
- **Content Security Policy**: Validate CSP headers and inline script restrictions

**Backend Security (.NET 8):**
- **API Security**: Input validation, output encoding, proper HTTP status codes
- **Data Access Security**: Entity Framework patterns, connection string security
- **Authentication Middleware**: JWT validation, token revocation, session security
- **Error Handling**: Security information disclosure prevention

**Integration Security:**
- **API Contract Security**: Ensure frontend validation matches backend expectations
- **Cross-Origin Security**: CORS configuration, preflight handling
- **Data Flow Security**: End-to-end data validation and sanitization
- **Communication Security**: HTTPS enforcement, secure headers

Label findings as `[FRONTEND_SECURITY]`, `[BACKEND_SECURITY]`, or `[INTEGRATION_SECURITY]`.
</step_3_cross_stack_security_analysis>

<step_4_dependency_security_analysis>
**Step 4: Dependency and Supply Chain Security**
Review dependency security implications:

**Dependency Vulnerability Analysis:**
- Review dependency scan results for known vulnerabilities (Critical, High, Medium)
- Check for outdated packages with security implications
- Validate new dependencies against approved security standards
- Assess transitive dependency risks and update requirements

**Supply Chain Security:**
- Verify package integrity and source authenticity
- Check for dependency confusion or typosquatting risks
- Review package permissions and access requirements
- Validate CI/CD pipeline security for dependency management

**Security Update Management:**
- Assess impact of security updates on application functionality
- Review automated security update configuration (Dependabot, etc.)
- Check for security advisory compliance and response procedures

Label findings as `[DEPENDENCY_VULNERABILITY]`, `[SUPPLY_CHAIN_RISK]`, or `[UPDATE_REQUIRED]`.
</step_4_dependency_security_analysis>

<step_5_ai_coder_security_education>
**Step 5: AI Coder Security Pattern Analysis**
Evaluate how security changes support AI coder education:

**Secure Coding Pattern Reinforcement:**
- Identify excellent security practices that should be replicated
- Note innovative security approaches that advance project security standards
- Celebrate proper application of established security frameworks
- Highlight security maintainability and defense-in-depth improvements

**Security Learning Opportunities:**
- Identify missed opportunities for better security implementation

<step_6_deployment_decision_matrix>
**Step 6: Security-Based Deployment Decision**

Categorize all security findings using the Zarichney API Security Decision Matrix:

**üö® BLOCK DEPLOYMENT:**
- Critical vulnerabilities (SQL injection, authentication bypass, secrets exposure)
- Hardcoded credentials or API keys in code
- Authentication/authorization system failures
- High-severity dependency vulnerabilities in critical components

**‚ö†Ô∏è CONDITIONAL DEPLOYMENT (Security Review Required):**
- Medium-severity vulnerabilities requiring mitigation timeline
- New authentication/authorization patterns requiring validation
- Significant security configuration changes
- Dependency vulnerabilities with available patches

**üìã DEPLOY WITH MONITORING:**
- Low-risk security improvements or fixes
- Security enhancement opportunities for future implementation
- Documentation updates for security procedures
- Minor dependency updates with security benefits

**üõ°Ô∏è CELEBRATE SECURITY WINS:**
- Vulnerability fixes and security improvements
- Implementation of security best practices
- Security test coverage improvements
- Proactive security hardening measures

**Final Deployment Decision:** Based on highest severity finding:
- **BLOCK**: Any critical security issues present
- **CONDITIONAL**: High/medium issues requiring security review
- **DEPLOY**: Low-risk or security improvements only

Provide specific file:line references and actionable security remediation steps.

**IMPORTANT:** Do not provide time estimates for security fixes. AI coder execution timelines differ significantly from human developer estimates - focus on security priority and urgency instead.

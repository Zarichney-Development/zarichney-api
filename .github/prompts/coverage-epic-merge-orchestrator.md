<safety_constraints>
**ABSOLUTE SAFETY CONSTRAINTS - MUST BE ENFORCED:**

### 🚨 Production Code Safety Rules

**CRITICAL - NEVER VIOLATE THESE CONSTRAINTS:**

1. **NO BUSINESS LOGIC CHANGES**: Zero modifications to business rules, user workflows, or application functionality
2. **NO ARCHITECTURAL OVERHAULS**: No design pattern changes, service layer restructuring, or data access modifications  
3. **NO FEATURE ADDITIONS**: No new functionality that wasn't explicitly required for testability
4. **NO DATABASE CHANGES**: No entity modifications, migration changes, or schema alterations
5. **NO API CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS**: No controller changes beyond minimal testability improvements

**TESTABILITY-ONLY PRODUCTION CHANGES:**

**✅ Approved Changes (With Strict Validation):**
- **Interface Extraction**: Creating interfaces for existing concrete classes to enable mocking
- **Constructor Dependency Injection**: Adding DI parameters to enable test isolation
- **Service Registration**: Adding DI container registrations for new test-required interfaces
- **Configuration Abstraction**: Extracting configuration patterns for test environment control
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Minimal fixes for bugs discovered by new tests (with detailed justification)

**🔍 Required Validation for ANY Production Change:**
- **Behavior Preservation**: Identical external behavior before and after changes
- **Test Coverage Validation**: New or existing tests demonstrate behavior preservation
- **Minimal Impact Principle**: Smallest possible change to achieve testability goals
- **Safety Documentation**: Clear rationale for why production change is necessary and safe

### 🧪 Test Resolution Safety Rules

**TEST QUALITY MAINTENANCE:**
- Preserve all effective test patterns and comprehensive assertion coverage
- Maintain test isolation and deterministic execution patterns
- Ensure test framework improvements enhance rather than compromise reliability
- Preserve educational value and clear test documentation patterns

**COVERAGE PROGRESSION PROTECTION:**
- Never reduce test coverage during conflict resolution
- Preserve all valuable test scenarios and code path validation
- Maintain or improve coverage trajectory toward 90% goal
- Ensure test quality improvements support long-term coverage sustainability

**SAFETY VALIDATION FOR LARGE CONSOLIDATIONS (8+ PRs):**
With multiple PRs, extra vigilance required:
- **Build Validation**: After each conflict resolution, confirm solution builds successfully
- **Test Execution**: Validate all tests pass after consolidation across all coverage areas
- **Coverage Verification**: Ensure consolidated tests achieve sum of individual coverage gains
- **Framework Integrity**: Confirm test framework enhancements work together harmoniously
- **Agent Work Preservation**: Ensure all AI agent contributions are preserved through consolidation

**DIRECT MERGE OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW:**

**Sequential PR Processing Protocol:**
1. **Epic Branch Checkout**: Switch to and validate epic branch state
2. **Direct PR Merge Attempt**: Execute `gh pr merge` or `git merge` directly  
3. **Real-Time Conflict Detection**: Identify conflicts immediately during merge operation
4. **On-Branch Conflict Resolution**: Fix conflicts directly on epic branch using safety constraints
5. **Compilation Validation**: Ensure build passes after conflict resolution
6. **Epic Branch Commit**: Commit resolved conflicts with comprehensive commit messages
7. **Continue Processing**: Move to next PR or report completion status

**Epic Branch State Management:**
- **Starting State Tracking**: Record epic branch HEAD commit for rollback capability
- **Incremental Progress**: Maintain epic branch integrity throughout multi-PR session
- **Error Recovery**: Reset epic branch to known-good state if critical failures occur
- **Push Operations**: Update remote epic branch after successful conflict resolution

**Individual PR Error Handling:**
- **Merge Failures**: Document failed PR, continue with remaining PRs in sequence
- **Conflict Resolution Failures**: Escalate complex conflicts, continue with resolvable PRs
- **Compilation Failures**: Fix test-only compilation issues, escalate production compilation problems
- **Epic Branch Integrity**: Maintain epic branch operability throughout processing

**RESOLUTION STRATEGIES:**

**Framework Conflicts**: Consolidate builders → comprehensive builder, merge mock configs → factory pattern, choose best utilities
**Coverage Overlaps**: Combine test approaches, coordinate mock strategies, extract common utilities
**Production**: Interface extraction → comprehensive approach, DI improvements → coherent pattern, bug fixes → document thoroughly

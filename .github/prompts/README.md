**Last Updated:** 2025-08-04

**Parent:** [`.github`](../README.md)

## 1. Purpose & Responsibility

* **What it is:** Sophisticated AI-powered code review system featuring four specialized AI agents that provide comprehensive analysis of pull requests using advanced prompt engineering techniques.
* **Key Responsibilities:** 
    * **Technical Debt Analysis**: Identify and categorize debt across architecture, code, testing, and documentation
    * **Standards Compliance**: Enforce coding standards, SOLID principles, and project-specific conventions
    * **Test Quality Assessment**: Analyze test coverage, patterns, and quality impact
    * **Security Analysis**: Assess vulnerabilities, threats, and deployment security decisions
    * **AI Coder Education**: Reinforce sustainable development patterns for AI-assisted codebases
* **Why it exists:** To provide contextual, comprehensive code review that goes beyond traditional linting by understanding project intent, architectural patterns, and long-term maintainability. This AI-first approach eliminates crude programmatic checks in favor of intelligent, educational analysis.

## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

### **The Four AI Sentinels**
* **🔍 DebtSentinel** (`tech-debt-analysis.md`, ~270 lines): Technical debt analysis with GitHub label strategic context and epic-aware prioritization
* **🛡️ StandardsGuardian** (`standards-compliance.md`, ~350 lines): Standards compliance with component-specific analysis and epic alignment
* **🧪 TestMaster** (`testing-analysis.md`, ~370 lines): Test quality assessment with coverage phase intelligence and progressive testing strategy
* **🔒 SecuritySentinel** (`security-analysis.md`, ~370 lines): Security vulnerability assessment with automation context awareness and component-specific threat modeling

### **Advanced Prompt Engineering Features**
Based on academic research in AI-driven technical debt analysis:
* **Expert Personas**: Principal-level expertise (15-20+ years) with AI coder mentorship specialization
* **Context Ingestion**: Comprehensive project documentation analysis before evaluation
* **Chain-of-Thought Analysis**: 5-6 step structured reasoning processes with evidence-based conclusions
* **Project-Specific Taxonomies**: Tailored to .NET 8/Angular 19 tech stack and monorepo architecture
* **Decision Matrices**: Objective prioritization frameworks (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Celebrate)
* **Educational Focus**: AI coder learning reinforcement and sustainable development patterns

### **GitHub Label Integration**
All four AI agents now leverage GitHub issue labels for enhanced contextual analysis:
* **Epic-Aware Analysis**: `epic:testing-coverage-to-90`, `epic:performance-optimization` labels provide long-term strategic context for prioritization and alignment
* **Component-Specific Intelligence**: `component:backend-api`, `component:frontend-ui`, `component:database`, `component:security` labels enable targeted analysis with component-specific standards and threat models
* **Coverage Phase Intelligence**: `coverage:phase-1` through `coverage:phase-6` labels inform progressive testing strategy and phase-appropriate expectations  
* **Automation Context Awareness**: `automation:ci-environment`, `automation:github-actions` labels help security analysis understand execution context
* **Strategic Prioritization**: `priority:critical`, `priority:high`, `quality:performance`, `quality:maintainability` labels adjust analysis rigor and deployment decision thresholds

### **Technical Implementation**
* **Template System**: Markdown prompts with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` dynamic context injection
* **Workflow Integration**: GitHub Actions jobs load templates and perform string replacement
* **Branch-Aware Activation**: 
  - Feature branches: Build + Test only
  - Develop PRs: Testing + Standards + Tech Debt analysis
  - Main PRs: Full analysis including Security assessment
* **Quality Gates**: Critical findings can block deployment with specific remediation guidance

## 3. Interface Contract & Assumptions

### **AI Analysis Input Requirements**
* **Git Context**: PR number, author, source/target branches, linked issues, git diff with file changes
* **GitHub Label Context**: Issue labels providing strategic, component, and priority context for targeted analysis
* **Project Documentation**: Access to `CLAUDE.md`, `/Docs/Standards/`, module `README.md` files
* **Build Artifacts**: Test results, coverage reports, security scan results (when available)
* **Branch Context**: Target branch determines analysis depth and security requirements

### **AI Analysis Output Guarantees**
* **Standardized Format**: GitHub markdown comments with consistent structure and emoji indicators
* **Specific References**: File:line locations with actionable remediation steps
* **Objective Prioritization**: Critical/High/Medium/Low categorization with clear justification
* **Educational Value**: AI coder learning insights and pattern reinforcement
* **Deployment Decisions**: Clear recommendations for merge/block with security assessment

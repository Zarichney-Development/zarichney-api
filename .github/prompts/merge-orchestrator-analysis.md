**STRUCTURED HOLISTIC ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:**

<step_1_findings_synthesis>
**Step 1: AI Sentinel Findings Synthesis**

**Critical Findings Consolidation:**
- Review all CRITICAL/BLOCK findings from the four AI Sentinels
- **SecuritySentinel Authority**: Any SecuritySentinel BLOCK decision is final and cannot be overridden
- **Other Critical Findings**: Consolidate architectural, standards, and testing critical issues
- **Deduplication**: Eliminate overlapping concerns raised by multiple agents

**Priority Reconciliation:**
- Identify conflicts where agents disagree on priority levels
- Apply business context to resolve priority disputes
- Consolidate similar findings from different perspectives
- Create unified priority assessment based on actual deployment risk

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Look for systemic issues indicated by multiple agents
- Identify isolated concerns vs. architectural problems
- Note positive patterns and improvements acknowledged by agents
- Assess whether critical findings indicate deeper design issues

Label consolidated findings as `[CRITICAL_CONSOLIDATED]`, `[HIGH_PRIORITY]`, `[MEDIUM_FOLLOWUP]`, or `[PATTERN_CONCERN]`.

- Consider strategic importance vs. tactical improvements
- Assess delivery urgency based on business needs

**Requirement Completeness:**
- Validate all Issue requirements are satisfied by the PR
- Identify any remaining work needed to close the Issue
- Note any assumptions or decisions that should be documented
- Check for proper implementation of requested functionality

Label findings as `[ISSUE_ALIGNED]`, `[REQUIREMENT_GAP]`, `[SCOPE_EXPANSION]`, or `[VALUE_DELIVERED]`.
</step_2_issue_alignment_validation>

<step_3_risk_benefit_analysis>
**Step 3: Deployment Risk-Benefit Analysis**

**Technical Risk Assessment:**
- Evaluate genuine deployment risks from all agent findings
- Distinguish between "nice to have" improvements and actual risks
- Assess backward compatibility and system stability impact
- Consider rollback scenarios and risk mitigation options

**Business Impact Analysis:**
- Weigh technical concerns against business delivery needs
- Evaluate cost of delay vs. cost of technical debt
- Consider user expectations and stakeholder commitments
- Assess impact on development velocity and team morale

**Acceptable Technical Debt Framework:**
- Identify technical debt that can be safely deferred
- Determine which issues require immediate resolution vs. follow-up
- Apply project-specific debt tolerance based on context
- Ensure debt items are properly tracked for future attention

**Deployment Readiness:**
- Synthesize security, stability, and functionality readiness
- Consider monitoring and observability for post-deployment validation
- Evaluate team capacity for post-deployment support
- Assess overall system health impact

Label findings as `[DEPLOYMENT_SAFE]`, `[ACCEPTABLE_DEBT]`, `[REQUIRES_FOLLOWUP]`, or `[UNACCEPTABLE_RISK]`.

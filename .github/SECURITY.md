## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Report via GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)

1. Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/Zarichney-Development/zarichney-api/security/advisories) page
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form with detailed information

### 2. Report via Email

If GitHub Security Advisories are not suitable, you can email security issues to:
- **Email**: security@zarichney.com
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] Zarichney API - Brief Description

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much information as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue:

- **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, Authentication Bypass)
- **Affected Components**: Specific endpoints, services, or features
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential security impact and affected users
- **Proof of Concept**: Code samples or screenshots (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have recommendations for remediation

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding promptly to security reports:

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Regular updates throughout the investigation process
- **Resolution**: Varies based on complexity, but we aim for swift remediation

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure principles:

1. **No Public Disclosure**: Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've had a chance to address it
2. **Coordinated Release**: We will work with you to coordinate any public disclosure
3. **Recognition**: We will acknowledge your contribution (with your permission) in our security advisories

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Contributions

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Authentication**: Follow established authentication patterns
- **Authorization**: Implement proper role-based access controls
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up to date and review security advisories

### Development Environment

- **API Keys**: Use environment variables for all API keys and secrets
- **Database**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages

### Testing

- **Security Tests**: Include security-focused test cases
- **Integration Tests**: Test authentication and authorization flows
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies

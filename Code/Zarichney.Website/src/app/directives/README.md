## 1. Purpose & Responsibility

* **What it is:** Custom Angular directives that provide reusable DOM manipulation and event handling functionality across the application. These directives encapsulate common UI behaviors and interactions that can be applied to any element.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
    * Custom DOM event handling and manipulation
    * Reusable UI interaction patterns
    * Cross-component behavioral functionality
    * Enhanced accessibility and user experience features
    * Integration with Angular's directive system and lifecycle
* **Why it exists:** To create reusable, declarative UI behaviors that can be applied across components without code duplication, while providing a clean separation between component logic and DOM manipulation concerns.

## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

* **High-Level Design:** Collection of attribute directives that follow Angular's directive patterns, providing clean, declarative ways to add behavior to DOM elements. Each directive focuses on a specific interaction pattern or UI enhancement.
* **Core Logic Flow:**
    1. **Directive Application:** Directives applied to DOM elements via attribute selectors
    2. **Event Binding:** Directives bind to DOM events and provide custom handling
    3. **Host Integration:** Directives integrate with host element lifecycle and properties
    4. **Cleanup:** Proper cleanup of event listeners and resources on directive destruction
* **Key Data Structures:**
    * Angular directive classes with appropriate decorators
    * Host element references for DOM manipulation
    * Event listener management for cleanup
    * Input/output properties for directive configuration
* **State Management:**
    * **Local State:** Each directive instance maintains its own state
    * **Host Integration:** State synchronized with host element properties
    * **Event Emitters:** Custom events emitted for parent component communication

        L --> M[Event Handling]
        M --> N[OnDestroy - Cleanup]
    ```

## 3. Interface Contract & Assumptions

* **Key Public Interfaces (for external callers):**
    * `ClickOutsideDirective`:
        * **Purpose:** Detect clicks outside of the host element for dropdown/modal closure
        * **Critical Preconditions:** Host element attached to DOM, document click events available
        * **Critical Postconditions:** Events emitted when clicks occur outside element boundaries
        * **Non-Obvious Error Handling:** Handles detached elements, disabled states, event bubbling
    * Directive Input Properties:
        * **Purpose:** Configure directive behavior through template binding
        * **Critical Preconditions:** Valid input values, proper template syntax
        * **Critical Postconditions:** Directive configured according to input parameters
        * **Non-Obvious Error Handling:** Default values for missing inputs, type validation
    * Directive Output Events:
        * **Purpose:** Communicate directive events to parent components
        * **Critical Preconditions:** Event emitter properly configured, parent handlers available
        * **Critical Postconditions:** Custom events emitted with appropriate data
        * **Non-Obvious Error Handling:** Event emission even when no handlers present
* **Critical Assumptions:**
    * **DOM Availability:** Assumes browser environment with full DOM access
    * **Event System:** Relies on standard DOM event handling and propagation
    * **Angular Integration:** Assumes proper Angular directive lifecycle management
    * **Performance:** Assumes reasonable number of directive instances for performance

## 4. Local Conventions & Constraints (Beyond Global Standards)

* **Directive Design:**
    * **Single Responsibility:** Each directive focuses on one specific behavior
    * **Attribute Directives:** Preference for attribute directives over structural ones
    * **Host Integration:** Proper use of @HostBinding and @HostListener decorators
    * **Memory Management:** Explicit cleanup of event listeners in OnDestroy
* **Naming Conventions:**
    * **Selector:** Camel-case attribute selectors (e.g., `clickOutside`)
    * **Class Names:** PascalCase with Directive suffix (e.g., `ClickOutsideDirective`)
    * **Input/Output:** Descriptive names for inputs and outputs
* **Event Handling:**
    * **Passive Listeners:** Use passive event listeners where appropriate
    * **Event Delegation:** Consider event delegation for performance
    * **Cleanup:** Always remove event listeners in OnDestroy
* **Testing:**
    * **Directive Testing:** Use ComponentFixture with test host components
    * **Event Testing:** Test event emission and handling scenarios
    * **Edge Cases:** Test boundary conditions and error scenarios

## 5. How to Work With This Code

* **Setup:**
    * Directives are automatically available when imported in module declarations
    * Ensure proper Angular environment with directive support
    * Consider performance implications of global event listeners
* **Development Guidelines:**
    * **Directive Creation:** Use Angular CLI: `ng generate directive directives/directive-name`
    * **Event Management:** Always clean up event listeners in OnDestroy lifecycle hook
    * **Testing:** Create comprehensive tests for directive behavior and edge cases
    * **Documentation:** Document directive inputs, outputs, and usage examples
* **Testing:**
    * **Location:** `.spec.ts` files co-located with directive source files
    * **Testing Strategy:** Test directive behavior with host components, event scenarios
    * **Mock Strategy:** Mock DOM events and element interactions where needed
* **Common Pitfalls / Gotchas:**
    * **Memory Leaks:** Forgetting to remove event listeners causes memory leaks
    * **Event Bubbling:** Understanding event propagation and stopping when necessary
    * **SSR Compatibility:** Directives must handle server-side rendering gracefully
    * **Performance:** Too many global event listeners can impact performance
    * **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure directive behavior works across target browsers

## 6. Dependencies

* **Internal Code Dependencies:**
    * No direct internal dependencies - directives are foundational utilities
* **External Library Dependencies:**
    * **Angular Core:** Directive decorators, lifecycle hooks, and dependency injection
    * **Angular Common:** Common directive patterns and utilities
    * **RxJS:** For complex event handling scenarios with observables
* **Dependents (Impact of Changes):**
    * [`../components`](../components/README.md) - UI components that use directives for behavior
    * [`../routes`](../routes/README.md) - Route components that apply directives to elements
    * **Application-wide:** Any template that uses directive selectors

## 7. Rationale & Key Historical Context

* **Custom Directive Creation:** Built to address specific UI interaction needs not covered by standard Angular directives
* **Click Outside Pattern:** Common UI pattern for closing dropdowns, modals, and overlays when user clicks elsewhere
* **Reusability Focus:** Designed to be reusable across different components and contexts
* **Performance Consideration:** Implemented with performance in mind to avoid excessive event listeners
* **Angular Best Practices:** Follows Angular directive patterns and lifecycle management

## 8. Known Issues & TODOs

* **Additional Directives:** Potential for more custom directives as UI patterns emerge
* **Performance Optimization:** Consider directive pooling or event delegation for large applications
* **Testing Coverage:** Comprehensive test suite for all directive behaviors and edge cases
* **Documentation:** Usage examples and API documentation for directive consumers
* **Accessibility:** Ensure directives enhance rather than hinder accessibility features

## 1. Purpose & Responsibility

* **What it is:** Comprehensive unit test suite for session management services in the zarichney-api application, covering session lifecycle, user session tracking, session cleanup, middleware integration, and session data models.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Unit testing of session creation, validation, and termination workflows
  - Testing of session data persistence and retrieval mechanisms
  - Validation of session cleanup and maintenance services
  - Testing of session middleware and request pipeline integration
  - Verification of session security and data integrity
  - Testing of concurrent session management and user session limits
* **Why it exists:** To ensure reliable and secure session management that supports user experience continuity while maintaining security boundaries and proper resource cleanup in a stateless HTTP environment.

### Child Test Modules:
* **SessionCleanup:** [./SessionCleanup/README.md](./SessionCleanup/README.md) - Session cleanup and maintenance service testing
* **SessionManager:** [./SessionManager/README.md](./SessionManager/README.md) - Core session management service testing
* **SessionMiddleware:** [./SessionMiddleware/README.md](./SessionMiddleware/README.md) - Session middleware pipeline testing

### Additional Test Files:
* **SessionManagerTests.cs** (45,497 lines) - Comprehensive session manager functionality testing
* **SessionCleanupServiceTests.cs** (17,298 lines) - Session cleanup service behavior testing
* **SessionMiddlewareTests.cs** (14,210 lines) - Session middleware integration testing
* **SessionModelsTests.cs** (11,930 lines) - Session data model validation testing

## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

* **High-Level Design:** Session management tests follow a comprehensive approach covering session lifecycle from creation through cleanup, with emphasis on concurrent access patterns, data integrity, and security boundaries. Tests validate both in-memory and persistent session storage scenarios.
* **Core Logic Flow:**
  1. **Session Creation:** New user sessions are established with unique identifiers
  2. **Session Validation:** Existing sessions are validated and refreshed
  3. **Session Data Management:** Session data is stored, retrieved, and updated securely
  4. **Session Cleanup:** Expired and invalid sessions are automatically cleaned up
  5. **Middleware Integration:** Session data is seamlessly available throughout request pipeline
* **Key Data Structures:**
  - `UserSession` - Core session entity with user context and metadata
  - `SessionData` - Session storage models for persistent and transient data
  - `SessionConfiguration` - Session behavior and timeout configuration
  - `SessionCleanupResult` - Results and metrics from cleanup operations
* **State Management:** Sessions maintain state across stateless HTTP requests through secure server-side storage with configurable persistence and caching layers
* **Session Architecture:**

      H --> K[Create New Session]
      K --> J
      J --> L[Update Session Data]
      L --> M[Response]
  ```

    * **Purpose:** Validate session data models, serialization, and data integrity constraints
    * **Critical Preconditions:** Valid session data structures, proper serialization configuration
    * **Critical Postconditions:** Data integrity maintained, proper serialization/deserialization, model validation rules enforced
    * **Non-Obvious Error Handling:** Tests data corruption scenarios, serialization version compatibility, and model validation edge cases

* **Critical Assumptions:**
  * **Storage Reliability:** Session storage backend is reliable and maintains data consistency
  * **Clock Synchronization:** Session expiration relies on synchronized system time across server instances
  * **Thread Safety:** Session operations are thread-safe for concurrent user access
  * **Data Persistence:** Session data persists across application restarts when configured for persistent storage
  * **Security Boundaries:** Session data is properly isolated between users and protected from unauthorized access
  * **Performance Scalability:** Session operations scale appropriately with user load and session volume

## 4. Local Conventions & Constraints

* **Configuration:** Tests use dedicated session configuration with short timeouts for faster test execution and predictable cleanup behavior
* **Directory Structure:**
  - Individual session services tested in dedicated subdirectories
  - Cross-cutting session tests in parent directory files
  - Session model tests isolated to maintain clear separation of concerns
* **Technology Choices:**
  - ASP.NET Core Session middleware for session management testing
  - Entity Framework Core or in-memory storage for session persistence testing
  - Background service testing for automated cleanup operations
  - Concurrent collection testing for thread-safe session operations
* **Performance Notes:** Session tests must validate performance characteristics including session lookup speed and cleanup efficiency
* **Security Notes:** Tests verify session security including session hijacking prevention, secure session identifiers, and proper data isolation

## 5. How to Work With This Code

* **Setup:**
  - Configure test session storage (in-memory or database) with appropriate cleanup intervals
  - Set up test users and authentication contexts for session creation
  - Initialize session middleware with test-specific configuration

## 1. Purpose & Rationale (Why?)

This directory contains unit tests specifically for the **internal logic of the `PublicController` action methods**, isolated from the ASP.NET Core pipeline and real service implementations.

* **Why Unit Tests?** To provide fast, focused feedback on the controller's logic for handling public requests. They ensure the controller correctly:
    * Calls the appropriate methods on mocked dependencies (e.g., `IStatusService`, `IConfiguration`).
    * Handles the results returned by the mocked dependencies.
    * Translates results or exceptions into the correct `ActionResult` (e.g., `OkObjectResult`, `StatusCodeResult`).
* **Why Mock Dependencies?** To isolate the controller's logic. Any dependencies (`IStatusService`, `IConfiguration`, `ILogger`) are mocked. User context (`HttpContext`) mocking is generally unnecessary as these actions should not depend on authenticated user details.

## 2. Scope & Key Functionality Tested (What?)

These tests focus on the code *within* the `PublicController` actions:

* **Service Invocation:** Ensuring the correct methods on `IStatusService` or `IConfiguration` are called, if applicable.
* **Result Handling:** Testing how data or exceptions from mocked dependencies are processed and mapped to `ActionResult` types.
* **Response Construction:** Verifying that the correct `ActionResult` (e.g., `OkObjectResult` with specific data, simple `OkResult`) is returned based on the logic within the action method.

## 3. Test Environment Setup

* **Instantiation:** `PublicController` is instantiated directly in tests.
* **Mocking:** Mocks for any injected dependencies (`IStatusService`, `IConfiguration`, `ILogger<PublicController>`) must be provided. `HttpContext` mocking is typically not needed.

## 4. Maintenance Notes & Troubleshooting

* **Dependency Mocking:** Ensure mocks accurately reflect the expected return values or behavior of any services used by the public endpoints.
* **Simplicity:** These tests should generally be straightforward as public endpoints often have minimal logic beyond potentially calling a single service or returning static data. Complexity might indicate logic that should potentially reside in a service layer instead.

## 5. Test Cases & TODOs

### `HealthCheck` Action
* **TODO:** Test action returns `OkObjectResult` or `OkResult` with the expected value/status code. (May not have dependencies to mock).

### `GetPublicStatus` Action (If exists)
* **TODO:** Test `_statusService.GetPublicStatusAsync` (or similar) called.
* **TODO:** Test handling successful service result -> verify `OkObjectResult` with status data.
* **TODO:** Test handling failure/exception from service -> verify appropriate error `ActionResult`.

### `GetPublicConfig` Action (If exists)
* **TODO:** Test interaction with `IConfiguration` mock (if applicable).
* **TODO:** Test handling successful retrieval -> verify `OkObjectResult` with expected config data.
* **TODO:** Test handling missing configuration -> verify appropriate `ActionResult` (e.g., `NotFoundResult` or default value).

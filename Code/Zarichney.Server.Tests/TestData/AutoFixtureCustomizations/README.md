# README: /Framework/TestData/AutoFixtureCustomizations Directory

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-22
**Parent:** `../README.md`

## 1. Purpose & Responsibility

This directory is designated to house advanced, reusable **AutoFixture customizations** for the `Zarichney.Server.Tests` project. These customizations typically involve implementations of `AutoFixture.ISpecimenBuilder` and `AutoFixture.ICustomization`.

The primary responsibilities of components within this directory are:
* **To simplify the generation of complex, valid, and realistic test data** for domain models, Entity Framework Core (EF Core) entities, and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used in both unit and integration tests.
* **To encapsulate common data generation rules and constraints** that go beyond basic AutoFixture capabilities, ensuring consistency and reducing boilerplate in test setup.
* **To handle specific challenges** in test data generation, such as managing EF Core navigation properties, omitting database-generated IDs, or ensuring data adheres to specific invariants.

This initiative directly supports the goals outlined in the `../../TechnicalDesignDocument.md` (specifically TDD FRMK-002) and aligns with best practices for robust test data management detailed in the "Research Report" (Sec 4.1) and the specific testing guides (`../../../Docs/Standards/UnitTestCaseDevelopment.md`, `../../../Docs/Standards/IntegrationTestCaseDevelopment.md`).

**Note:** This directory is being established as per the framework augmentation roadmap. It will be populated with customizations as they are developed.

## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

AutoFixture's extensibility is leveraged through two main interfaces:

* **`ISpecimenBuilder`:**
    * Allows fine-grained control over how AutoFixture creates instances of specific types or how it populates specific properties.
    * Useful for:
        * Ensuring domain model invariants (e.g., a `Product`'s price is always positive, an SKU matches a defined pattern).
        * Customizing the creation of EF Core entities (e.g., setting default states, ignoring certain navigation properties by default, or correctly initializing backing fields).
        * Providing default values for specific properties across multiple types.
        * Omitting auto-generation for properties that should not be set by tests (e.g., database-generated IDs before an entity is saved).
* **`ICustomization`:**
    * Provides a way to group multiple `ISpecimenBuilder` instances and other `IFixture` configurations (like adding behaviors or injecting specific instances) into a single, reusable unit.
    * Example: A `ProductDomainCustomization` might include specimen builders for `Product`, `Category`, and `Review` entities, along with a behavior like `OmitOnRecursionBehavior` to handle circular dependencies in EF Core navigation properties.
* **Application:**
    * These customizations can be applied directly to an `IFixture` instance within test setup: `fixture.Customize(new MyDomainCustomization());`.
    * They can also be incorporated into custom `[AutoData]` attributes to ensure project-wide consistency in how certain types of test data are generated.

## 3. Interface Contract & Assumptions

* **Interface for Test Writers:**
    * Test developers will primarily use these components by applying `ICustomization` instances to their `IFixture` objects (often obtained via `_fixture` in base test classes or from `[AutoData]` attributes).
    * `var fixture = new Fixture().Customize(new EntityFrameworkCoreCustomization());`
    * Alternatively, if custom `[AutoData]` attributes are created incorporating these customizations, developers will use those attributes on their test methods.
* **Assumptions:**
    * The customizations implemented here are thoroughly tested to ensure they produce valid and meaningful objects according to the domain rules and database constraints of the `Zarichney.Server`.
    * Developers understand when and how to apply these customizations to effectively generate data for their specific test scenarios.
    * These customizations correctly handle EF Core specifics, such as navigation properties and concurrency tokens, to avoid issues during testing with `DatabaseFixture`.

## 4. Local Conventions & Constraints

* **Naming:**
    * Specimen Builders: `[TargetType]SpecimenBuilder.cs` (e.g., `RecipeEntitySpecimenBuilder.cs`).
    * Customizations: `[DomainAreaOrPurpose]Customization.cs` (e.g., `CookbookDomainCustomization.cs`, `EfCoreCustomization.cs`).
* **Location:** All shared, advanced AutoFixture customizations (`ISpecimenBuilder`, `ICustomization`) should reside directly within this directory.
* **Focus:** Each customization or builder should be focused on a specific domain area or a particular aspect of data generation (e.g., handling all EF Core related concerns).
* **Testing:** Customizations and specimen builders containing complex logic **must** have their own unit tests, likely located in `../../Unit/Framework/TestData/AutoFixtureCustomizations/`.
* **Documentation:** Each public customization and builder must have clear XML documentation explaining its purpose, what it configures, and any notable behaviors. This README should provide an overview of available customizations.

## 5. How to Work With This Code

### Defining Customizations (Conceptual Examples)

* **Example `ISpecimenBuilder` (e.g., for omitting DB IDs):**
    ```csharp
    // In SomeEntityIdOmitterBuilder.cs
    public class SomeEntityIdOmitterBuilder : ISpecimenBuilder
    {
        public object Create(object request, ISpecimenContext context)
        {
            var pi = request as PropertyInfo;
            if (pi != null && pi.Name == "Id" && pi.DeclaringType.Name.EndsWith("Entity"))
            {
                return OmitSpecimen.Instance; // Prevents AutoFixture from setting the Id
            }
            return new NoSpecimen();
        }
    }
    ```
* **Example `ICustomization` (e.g., for EF Core entities):**
    ```csharp
    // In EfCoreEntityCustomization.cs
    public class EfCoreEntityCustomization : ICustomization
    {
        public void Customize(IFixture fixture)
        {
            fixture.Behaviors.OfType<ThrowingRecursionBehavior>().ToList()
                .ForEach(b => fixture.Behaviors.Remove(b));
            fixture.Behaviors.Add(new OmitOnRecursionBehavior());

            // Could add multiple ISpecimenBuilders relevant to EF Core entities
            fixture.Customizations.Add(new SomeEntityIdOmitterBuilder());
            // fixture.Customizations.Add(new IgnoreVirtualMembersSpecimenBuilder()); // If needed
        }
    }
    ```

### Using Customizations in Tests

* **Directly:**
    ```csharp
    // In a test method's Arrange block:
    var fixture = new Fixture();
    fixture.Customize(new EfCoreEntityCustomization()); // Apply your custom rules
    // fixture.Customize(new CookbookDomainCustomization()); // Apply more specific rules

    var recipe = fixture.Create<RecipeEntity>(); // Will be created according to customizations
    ```
* **Via Custom `AutoData` Attribute (More Advanced - For Project-Wide Consistency):**
  A custom attribute could be created that automatically applies common customizations:
    ```csharp
    // public class ProjectAutoDataAttribute : AutoDataAttribute
    // {
    //     public ProjectAutoDataAttribute()
    //         : base(() => new Fixture().Customize(new EfCoreEntityCustomization())
    //                                   .Customize(new CookbookDomainCustomization()))
    //     { }
    // }

    // [Theory, ProjectAutoData] // Hypothetical usage
    // public void MyTestMethod(RecipeEntity recipe) { /* ... */ }
    ```
  Guidance on creating such attributes will be provided if this pattern is adopted widely.

## 6. Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

* **`Zarichney.Server` Project:** The domain models, DTOs, and EF Core entity classes defined in the `Zarichney.Server` project are the primary targets for these customizations.
* **`../../Unit/` and `../../Integration/` Tests:** These tests are the primary consumers of the customizations defined here, using them to generate test data.

### Key External Libraries

* **`AutoFixture`**: The core library providing `ISpecimenBuilder`, `ICustomization`, `IFixture`, and related interfaces and classes.

## 7. Rationale & Key Historical Context

This dedicated directory and the strategy of creating advanced AutoFixture customizations are being adopted to address TDD FRMK-002. The rationale includes:

* **Improved Realism:** To generate test data that more closely mimics real-world data and adheres to complex domain invariants and database constraints.
* **Reduced Boilerplate:** To significantly reduce repetitive data setup code within individual tests, making tests cleaner and more focused on their specific assertions.
* **Enhanced Maintainability:** To centralize data generation logic. If a domain rule changes, the corresponding customization can be updated in one place, rather than modifying numerous tests.
* **Handling Complex Object Graphs:** To effectively manage the creation of complex interconnected objects, especially EF Core entities with navigation properties and potential circular dependencies.

This approach is based on established best practices for test data management using AutoFixture, as highlighted in the "Research Report" (Sec 4.1) and testing guides.

## 8. Known Issues & TODOs

* **Initial Population (TDD FRMK-002):** The immediate TODO is to identify key domain entities and DTOs within `Zarichney.Server` that would most benefit from initial `ISpecimenBuilder` and `ICustomization` implementations. This includes:
    * Common EF Core entity patterns (ID omission, navigation property handling).
    * Core domain models from services like `Cookbook`, `Auth`, `Payment`.
* **Development of Custom `AutoData` Attributes:** Evaluate and potentially implement custom `[ProjectAutoData]` attributes that bundle common customizations for ease of use in tests.
* **Ongoing Identification:** Continuously identify new areas where custom AutoFixture setups can simplify test data generation as the application evolves.
* Refer to the "Framework Augmentation Roadmap (TODOs)" in `../../TechnicalDesignDocument.md` for broader framework enhancements.

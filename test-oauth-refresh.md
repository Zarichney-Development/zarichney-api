# Concurrency Control Test

This commit tests the concurrency control implementation to prevent duplicate workflow runs.

**Rapid sequential push test in progress...**

## Changes Applied
- Consolidated all workflows into single mega build pipeline (01-build.yml)
- Universal PR triggering with `branches: ['**']` 
- Branch-aware conditional logic for different analysis scenarios
- Sequential job dependencies with proper build gates
- All Claude AI analysis moved to single workflow for compatibility

## Expected Behavior
- **Feature → Epic**: Build + Test only (no AI analysis)
- **Epic → Develop**: Build + Test + Quality Analysis (Testing, Standards, Tech Debt)
- **Any → Main**: Build + Test + Quality + Security Analysis

## Testing Focus
Currently testing **consolidated mega build workflow** targeting develop branch
Expected: All quality analysis (Testing, Standards Compliance, Tech Debt) should run and post Claude AI comments

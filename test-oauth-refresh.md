# OAuth Authentication Fix Test - Quality Analysis Focus

This commit tests the OAuth authentication fixes applied to the Quality Analysis workflow.

## Changes Applied
- Added `github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` parameter to both Claude actions in 02-quality.yml
- Standards Compliance AI Analysis and Tech Debt AI Analysis now have proper GitHub token authentication
- Temporarily disabled Testing Analysis to focus debugging on Quality Analysis workflow

## Expected Behavior
- Standards Compliance AI Analysis should complete successfully and post real Claude comment
- Tech Debt AI Analysis should complete successfully and post real Claude comment  
- No more OAuth authentication errors: "App token exchange failed: 401 Unauthorized - Invalid OIDC token"
- Both Claude actions should use OAuth tokens properly with GitHub token fallback

## Testing Focus
Currently testing **Quality Analysis workflow only** (Testing Analysis temporarily disabled)

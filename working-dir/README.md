# Working Directory - Inter-Agent Communication Hub

**Purpose**: Shared artifact space for rich communication between the 12-agent development team without overloading the Codebase Manager's context window.

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-01  
**Session Management**: All files except this README.md are session-scoped and gitignored  
**Communication Standards**: Mandatory protocols ensure consistent artifact reporting across all 12 agents

## Overview

The `/working-dir/` serves as a temporary communication hub where agents create, update, and consume artifacts for effective handoffs. This reduces the "telephone game" effect and preserves rich context between specialized agents.

## Session Lifecycle

### Session Start
- **Cleanup**: Remove all files except README.md from previous sessions
- **Setup**: Create `session-state.md` to track current mission progress
- **Initialize**: Document GitHub issue context and initial task decomposition

### Session Progress
- **Artifacts**: Agents create analysis reports, design decisions, implementation notes
- **Handoffs**: Rich context transfer between agents via shared documents
- **Tracking**: Session state updated with each major milestone and artifact creation
- **Coordination**: Codebase Manager monitors for critical updates and plan adjustments

### Session End
- **Validation**: ComplianceOfficer uses artifacts for comprehensive pre-PR validation
- **Archive**: Critical insights captured in permanent documentation
- **Cleanup**: All session files removed (handled by next session start)

## Mandatory Communication Standards

**CRITICAL FOR ALL AGENTS**: These protocols are MANDATORY, not optional. Every agent must follow these exact standards to ensure effective team coordination and prevent communication gaps.

### Universal Agent Requirements

All agents (analysis, file-editing, and specialized) MUST follow these three mandatory protocols:

#### 1. Pre-Work Artifact Discovery (MANDATORY)
**BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK**:
```
üîç WORKING DIRECTORY DISCOVERY:
- Current artifacts reviewed: [list existing files checked]
- Relevant context found: [artifacts that inform current work]
- Integration opportunities: [how existing work will be built upon]
- Potential conflicts: [any overlapping concerns identified]
```

#### 2. Immediate Artifact Reporting (MANDATORY)
**WHEN CREATING/UPDATING ANY WORKING DIRECTORY FILE**:
```
üóÇÔ∏è WORKING DIRECTORY ARTIFACT CREATED:
- Filename: [exact-filename-with-extension]
- Purpose: [brief description of content and intended consumers]
- Context for Team: [what other agents need to know about this artifact]
- Dependencies: [what other artifacts this builds upon or relates to]
- Next Actions: [any follow-up coordination needed]
```

#### 3. Context Integration Reporting (REQUIRED)
**WHEN BUILDING UPON OTHER AGENTS' WORK**:
```
üîó ARTIFACT INTEGRATION:
- Source artifacts used: [specific files that informed this work]
- Integration approach: [how existing context was incorporated]
- Value addition: [what new insights or progress this provides]
- Handoff preparation: [context prepared for future agents]
```

### Communication Enforcement Standards

- **No Delayed Reporting**: Agents must report artifacts IMMEDIATELY upon creation, not in batch or summary format
- **Mandatory Discovery**: Every agent MUST check existing artifacts before starting work - no exceptions
- **Standard Format Compliance**: All reporting must use exact formats above for consistency
- **Team Awareness**: Every artifact must include context for other agents to understand relevance
- **Integration Continuity**: Agents must explicitly report how they build upon existing team work

## Agent Responsibilities

### All Agents Must
- **Execute Pre-Work Discovery**: Check existing artifacts using mandatory discovery format before starting ANY task
- **Report Artifacts Immediately**: Use exact artifact reporting format when creating/updating working directory files
- **Integrate Team Context**: Build upon existing artifacts and report integration using standard format
- **Follow Naming**: Use standard naming conventions for artifact discoverability
- **Preserve Context**: Document decisions, rationales, and important discoveries
- **Enable Team Coordination**: Provide context that enables other agents to understand and build upon work

### Codebase Manager Must
- **Monitor Directory**: Watch for critical updates that require plan adjustments
- **Maintain State**: Keep `session-state.md` current with all agent activities
- **Coordinate Handoffs**: Ensure agents consume relevant artifacts from other team members
- **Session Cleanup**: Initialize clean working directory for new missions
- **Verify Communication Compliance**: Confirm each agent reports artifacts using standardized formats
- **Enforce Discovery**: Ensure agents check existing artifacts before starting work
- **Track Continuity**: Monitor how artifacts build upon each other across agent engagements
- **Prevent Communication Gaps**: Intervene when agents miss mandatory reporting requirements

### ComplianceOfficer Must
- **Consume All Artifacts**: Review all agent outputs during pre-PR validation
- **Create Validation Reports**: Document comprehensive compliance assessment
- **Track Quality Gates**: Maintain validation checklists for issue completion

## Communication Protocol

### Mandatory Communication Sequence

**EVERY AGENT MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT SEQUENCE**:

1. **Pre-Work Discovery** (MANDATORY): Check existing artifacts using discovery format before starting
2. **Work Execution**: Complete assigned task with full context awareness
3. **Immediate Artifact Reporting** (MANDATORY): Report any files created using artifact reporting format
4. **Context Integration Reporting** (REQUIRED): Report how existing work was incorporated

### Standard Artifact Content Structure
```markdown
**Agent**: [Agent Name]
**Timestamp**: [ISO format]
**Mission Context**: [Related GitHub issue and subtask]
**Artifact Type**: [Analysis/Decision/Handoff/etc.]
**Team Integration**: [Artifacts reviewed and how they informed this work]

## Summary
[Brief overview of artifact contents]

## Context for Other Agents
[What other agents need to know - MANDATORY SECTION]

## Dependencies and Integration
[What other artifacts this builds upon or relates to]

## Recommendations
[Any suggested actions or plan adjustments]

## Next Agent Actions
[Specific guidance for agents who will consume this artifact]

## Detailed Content
[Full analysis, decisions, findings, etc.]
```

### Communication Verification Checklist

Before completing any task, agents must verify:
- [ ] Pre-work discovery completed and reported
- [ ] All artifacts created are immediately reported using standard format
- [ ] Context integration documented when building upon existing work
- [ ] Team awareness information provided for future agents
- [ ] Next actions clearly identified for coordination

### Updating Artifacts
- Always preserve original content
- Add timestamps for updates
- Clearly mark new sections
- Maintain continuity for consuming agents
- **Report Updates**: Use artifact reporting format when making updates
- **Document Integration**: Explain how updates build upon or relate to other artifacts
- **Preserve Team Context**: Ensure updates maintain visibility for other agents

## Integration with Standards

This working directory system integrates with:
- **CLAUDE.md Version 1.5**: Communication protocols align with multi-agent orchestration standards
- **DocumentationStandards.md**: Artifacts follow documentation standards for clarity
- **TaskManagementStandards.md**: Session tracking aligns with GitHub issue workflow
- **TestingStandards.md**: Test artifacts support comprehensive coverage planning
- **CodingStandards.md**: Implementation artifacts preserve architectural decisions

### Multi-Agent Team Coordination Framework

These communication standards enable:
- **Context Preservation**: Rich context transfer between specialized agents
- **Team Awareness**: Every agent understands what others have accomplished
- **Integration Continuity**: Work builds systematically upon previous agent deliverables
- **Communication Gaps Prevention**: Mandatory reporting ensures no work happens in isolation
- **Coordination Efficiency**: Codebase Manager can effectively orchestrate with full visibility

## Privacy and Security

- **No Secrets**: Never store API keys, passwords, or sensitive data in working directory
- **Session Scoped**: All files are temporary and session-specific
- **Gitignored**: Only this README.md is version controlled
- **Local Only**: All artifacts are local to the development session

## Examples

### Session State Template
```markdown
# Session State - Issue #123

**Started**: 2025-08-31T14:30:00Z
